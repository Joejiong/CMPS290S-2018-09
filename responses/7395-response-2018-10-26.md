## Response: 'Cloud Types for Eventual Consistency'

### Summary

The paper introduces cloud types which provide eventual consistency at the programming language level. In mobile devices, applications have to maintain local replicas of shared data, so that data is accessible even when the device is disconnected. Data declared using cloud types is automatically shared between the devices and is persisted both on local storage as well as in cloud storage. Revision diagrams are used to guarantee eventual consistency.

The paper then gives grocery shopping list example to explain the usage of cloud types. There are two important statements namely yield and flush which provides eventual and strong consistency respectively. The yield statement is required for propagating changes from local to other device replicas and from other replicas to local replica, but it is non-blocking. But to ensure synchronization for critical applications like airline reservation or banking app, the flush is used which blocks the execution until all local updates have been applied to global replica and final results have become visible to local replica.

Then the paper describes notations for understanding programming language semantics and how the system is designed using  these semantics. Cloud types are defined as fork-join automata which is a standard model in parallel computing. The fork primitive allows the programmer to introduce parallelism via threads which execute tasks and then join or merge is called to synchronize all the threads and resume sequential execution.

### What’s one thing I learned?
The paper is good from the perspective that it focuses on achieving consistency via programming languages. This makes a developer responsible for ensuring consistency and synchronization. But according to me, using fork-join automata for cloud types is nothing new (fork-join model is a popular design pattern since ages) and not referring to any other papers that too in 2012 when there were thousands of mobile applications in the market which were already dealing with consistency issues. Also, I found the word ‘cloud’ is just used to gain popularity in the Cloud computing world, as there is nothing explicit that makes cloud types any different from normally distributed data types.

### What’s a research-level question I have after having read this paper?
The paper explains the cloud types and gives few examples of how they can be used in distributed systems. But nothing has been said from implementation perspective. 
I have various questions, like:
What other data types existed which the mobile applications of 2012 were already using?
How cloud types is better than those data types?
What all applications have actually used these types? If, there is no such application, what are the potential problems with these cloud types?

### What’s a concrete step I can take toward answering the research question?
My concrete step will be to look at implementation of these cloud types in applications and if there are no such applications, then read papers that explain their disadvantages or comparison with other distributed data types.
