## Response: 'Logic and Lattices for Distributed Programming'

### Summary

<p align="justify">
The paper introduces BloomL which is an extension of Bloom to support arbitrary lattices. BloomL handles both scope dilemma and type dilemma. CvRDTs ensure that all replicas will be eventually consistent but do not guarantee application-level consistency. This is a kind of scope dilemma. Until now, sets are the only data type amenable to CALM analysis but BloomL incorporates other data structures like counters and maps thus resolves type dilemma.

### What I did not understand?
<p align="justify">
Lattices is something I don't really understand in detail and often get confused about morphism. According to me, I will better understand this paper by implementing a small application using BloomL.

### What’s a research-level question I have after having read this paper?
<p align="justify">
My research question is if BloomL is currently being used to create some distributed application. Digging into the code of this application will help understanding what BloomL can do and what not.
