## Response: 'Consistency in Non-Transactional Distributed Storage Systems'

### Summary
The paper surveys various consistency models and the authors claim that they provide a structured overview of these models in a distributed environment. The paper begins with the introduction of - concept of consistency and complex notations which are used to explain the consistency models. While talking about linearizability, the paper discusses safe and regular registers which were not mentioned in previous papers that we had read.

Under eventual consistency, the paper talks about strong eventual consistency in which all the replicas that have applied the same set of write operations will have the equivalent state. As I said, the notations used to explain the models is pretty confusing but the examples are very clear and few of these serializations helped me understand the consistency models better.

Overall, I liked the paper from the perspective that it will help in brushing up basic concepts of all consistency models.

### What’s one thing I learned?
The paper surveys the consistency models which we have read in the past so there was nothing new but few new concepts like safe and regular registers, strong eventual consistency were introduced. Examples posed in the paper helped me understand the consistency models better.

### What’s something I didn’t understand?
There was nothing new in the paper and we have discussed consistency models in detail, so there is nothing particular that I did not understand. But I wanted to ask that in case of safe and regular registers, the paper mentions that we allow a
set of return values for a read operation concurrent with a write. So is this a weaker form of linearizability? 
Also for strong eventual consistency, paper mentions about strong convergence constraint. According to me, why this constraint is explicitly mentioned? As the definition of eventual consistency already implies this constraint.

### What’s a research-level question I have after having read this paper?
Until now, what I feel is that various papers that we have read so far focused on explaining the concept of consistency but only a few of them actually provided a concrete implementation like the COPS paper. So, finally after reading this survey paper, I would like to explore these consistency models from implementation point of view and how current systems are dealing with consistency related issues.

### What’s a concrete step I can take toward answering the research question?
My concrete step will be to read more research papers where consistency models are explained from coding perspective to get a clear picture of these models in real-time settings.
