Sorry if this ends up being jumbled but I wrote this whilst dealing with a sinus headache.

This paper discusses and explores Brewers Conjecture, which states that consistency, availability, and partition-tolerance are impossible to simultaneously obtain with a web service. They do this by formalizing each desired property and some real-world scenarios. They formalize consistency as atomic data objects which enforces a total ordering to operations, even in a distributed/shared memory environment. Availability is formalize simply as any procedure that is part of a service must terminate and the service in question must provide a response. I find this definition rather weak. As while simple, whether or not a service is “available” can vary based on the use case and what failures are deemed acceptable. The paper does present a stronger definition where even in the face of a failure a response is given. At this point in the paper they don’t make it clear which definition they will be using. In the case of partition tolerance the formal definition is given as a system meeting the requirements for consistency (atomic requests) and availability (must provide a response). Though it does not cover total network failure, in that case the consistency/availability/partition requirements don’t matter as much. The paper uses a previously defined asynchronous network model and provides a theorem that states that it is impossible for a system to utilize a read/write object that is both available and has atomic consistency. This is then expanded in a corollary to state that atomic consistency is impossible at the same time as availability if no messages are lost. The paper shows how any two of the three properties previously discussed can be achieved simultaneously. In the case of atomicity and partition tolerance one can achieve a stronger liveness property if there are no failures. They do not mention specific examples of this beyond speculation. No partitions is trivial enough, and the paper provides more satisfactory examples. In the case of available and partition tolerant systems one can just return the initial value of a request every time it executes. Also discussed is the possibility of weakened consistency in an available and partition tolerant system (web caches). The paper then tries to look at partially synchronous models and then shows the same impossibility result. Although it goes more in depth with the solutions to 3.2.1 and a more weakly consistent system.

I didn’t particularly learn anything new from this paper, but definitely understood it better reading again after 3-4 months since my last reading. A good paper for switching gears to thinking more in depth about distributed systems. I still have some difficulty with the last proof for theorem 4. Though that may just be the headache. 

I still find this paper lacking in the realm of concrete real world examples to back up their claims. What would an experimental test and result set for weaker consistency or the centralized protocol from 3.2.1 look like? What are some better real world examples to help back up their claims? In a way the paper lacks the rigor in those areas that I am used to. It also makes coming up with a research question and a path forward on this topic very easy.
