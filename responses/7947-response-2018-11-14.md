# Response to "Consistency Analysis in Bloom: a CALM and Collected Approach"

#### Authors: Alvaro et al.

## Summary

The paper mainly deals with using the CALM (Consistency As Logical Monotonicity) approach to reason about distributed programs. Logical monotonicity boils down to the idea that a program input does not mess with earlier program outputs and programs that are logically monotonic do not require means to coordinate program state. The authors then use the BLOOM programming language to discuss consistency of programs in a declarative language.

## Questions

1. How does BLOOM implementation of channels relate to the channels in Golang (relating to CSP paper)?

## Things I didn't understand

1. How does unordered maintenance of state in bloom help achieve consistent state? Even thought the set may be disordered but set update happens in strict order (I think) as operators in the language define a means for updating program state. I'm not sure if that is what CALM approach is all about when implemented.
