Response to "CAP Twelve Years Later: How the "Rules" Have Changed"

Author: Eric Brewer


What is this paper about?

In the article Eric Brewer offers a glimpse of the changes in complexity of system design since CAP theorem was first announced and proved. He clarified the meaning of C, A, and P in CAP and why partition tolerance is not really optional property for a distributed system designer. Brewer addressed the abuse of the CAP theorem and gave examples of how application developers choose between Consistency and Availability in real world applications. He also discussed current (at the time) research into partition recovery and state convergence post partition. 

What's the one thing I learned?

The sections on partition recovery and compensating for mistakes were most insightful. It was good to learn that techniques which may not be necessarily technical (human intervention (even legal!)) are used to recover from mistakes made during network partition. CRDTs and were also something new to me. I intend to look more into CRDTs are their property of being "provably" eventually consistent interests me.

In my opinion the "rules" (if there were any) have not changed. The limit imposed by the CAP theorem still exists but in the article Brewer rightly corrected the misconceptions associated with the CAP theorem. It is important to understand what CAP theorem actually states and what that implies. The idea of picking "2 of 3" is not really accurate as it is not a binary choice.

The idea of merging conflicts during partition recovery was also insightful. It was interesting to look at partition recovery from the perspective of merging conflicts in a version control system or documents in google docs. It was good to get out of Gilbert and Lynch's Read/Write application abstraction to some real world applications which added a more practical perspective into the ideas of Consistency and Availability in the face of network partitions.

What I didn't understand?

Some techniques such as CRDTs and the concept of commutative operations. I need to read more about them to understand the sections where these are discussed in a much better light.

What's a research-level question I have after having read this paper?

This paper introduced the reader to quite a few ideas in managing consistency and availability in the face of network partition. One important idea that I am interested in was the idea of resolving conflicts. Brewer mentions merge conflicts and the user of version vectors to resolve conflicts and one result in particular by P. Mahajan et. al which "proved that this kind of causal consistency is the best possible outcome in general if the designer chooses to focus on availability". I am interested in this result and will be looking into it.  He also mentioned that the general problem of conflict resolution is "not solvable in practice" which I wanted to explore especially from the point-of-view of a version control system such as Git. 

What's a concrete step I can take toward answering the research question?

Brewer mentions commutative operations and CRDTs which guarantee convergence post partition. I would like to explore if CRDTs (or some other mechanism) could be used to resolve merge conflicts in Git without human interference. I would also like to explore the theory of conflict resolution. I feel in some cases higher level of intelligence is required to understand the semantics of the changes and then resolve conflicts and this might also be a useful way to look at the problem.
