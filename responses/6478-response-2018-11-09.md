# CMPS 290S Reading Response: Declarative Programming over Eventually Consistent Data Stores

## Summary
This paper describes a declarative programming model, backed by a contract language and contract enforcement system, for specifying consistency requirements for operations and transactions.The programming model is called *QUELEA*, and provides fine-grained specification of consistency requirements, but automatically enforces that "the system" operationally satisfies consistency requirements. The described implementation of QUELEA is a shim layer on top of the cassandra data store, and so "the system" that QUELEA enforces consistency for is any application that communicates with cassandra data stores through QUELEA.

The bulk of this paper details: the syntax and semantics of the contract language, the generality of the contract language, and extensions to the contract language to accommodate consistency for transactions. The contract language is based on first-order logic, which lends itself very well to declarative languages and specifications.

## Learning and Understanding
I learned that transitive closure cannot be expressed in first-order logic, somehow due to the compactness theorem. This is something I'll try to understand more deeply, but I thought it was an interesting, related thing that is relevant as R<sup>+</sup> is specifically mentioned to be a superset of the transitive closure, but not the transitive closure itself.

I also just wanted to say that the name of the domain of effects being *effect soup* is amusing.


## Research Question and What to Investigate
This is very related to what I want to do for my 2nd blog post, which is: given a way of implementing mixed consistencies in a programmable storage system, how do we specify the type of consistency we want in a declarative computation. So, I guess I'm interested to know why the authors use a contract language for specifying the desired consistency constraints over RDTs. I was imagining that the application logic itself could be specified declaratively, but perhaps that imposes a limitation that I was not thinking of (or maybe the limitation is just whether developers want to program declaratively or procedurally).

I also wonder if the use of a shim layer (such as QUELEA) is something that could be toggled on/off in a declarative layer. So, if I am using QUELEA and Cassandra, but my application logic is written in something like datalog, could I extend my datalog layer to turn off the QUELEA shim layer for applications run over a non-distributed system (or at least parts of a distributed system that are not distributed).
