This paper tackles the uncertainty in the ordering of events. The main core component of the paper is Lamport’s algorithm for the synchronization of logical clocks which can then be used to establish a total ordering for events in a distributed asynchronous system.  A logical clock is described as a simple counter where each event is given an number. Conditions such as messages having to be sent before they are received (no time travel). The concept of “happened before” is presented that represents a a partial ordering in a system. This is then extended to give us a total ordering of the system. Lamport gives a useful tool for reasoning about the “comes before” or “happens before” relation in what he calls a “space-time diagram” or as it is more commonly known today, a Lamport Diagram. With each event the “counter” ticks forward. I find it rather amusing and interesting that Lamport decides to bring in relativity with the last paragraph of this chapter. The author then decides to go into the realm of logical clocks which establishes the clock condition. This condition is that if an event occurs before another then the first event should happen at an earlier time. This is satisfied with two other conditions hold. These conditions are if both events are related to the same process and if one event is sent by one process then received by another then the first event must have occurred before the second. From there we can start creating total orderings of events in our distributed system. The author gives an example in the form of a mutual exclusion problem. 

The last part of the paper deals with physical clocks. This hits the reader with a wall of math that I am still working on understanding. Regardless of its impact on the work I think that the major contribution of this paper, at least from my understanding, is the preceding sections. Something new I learned looking at this paper a second (maybe third, not really sure) time is a better understanding of the clock condition. It clicked in a way it hadn’t before. I am also still unsure about the physical clocks section. It is dense and hard to get through.

To be entirely honest any research questions I can come up concerning this rather significant work are rather esoteric and border on the philosophical aspects of time as a concept instead of scientific properties. As such I don’t really have anything. The paper presents reasoning about ordering, clocks, and presents Lamport Diagrams.
