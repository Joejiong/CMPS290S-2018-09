# MixT: A Language for Mixing Consistency in Geodistributed Transactions

Matthew Milano, Andrew C. Myers

# Summary :

The authors introduce MixT, a DSL built on top of C++ to perform information
flow checks at compile time. This allows transactions across consistency levels
to be performed in a way that the system maintains correctness. The MixT system
includes run-time mechanisms and allows performance similar to weak consistency
performance while allowing (partial) stronger consistency conditions.

The authors demonstrate that weakly consistent data can affect program flow of
strongly consistent applications. MixT is implemented using C++ classes and
templates, and can be used embedded with C++. MixT presents a handle which can
be shimmed over most datastores, using native implementations of replication
and consistency.

The authors enforce non-interference across consistency levels using information
flow analysis to flag programs that could violate it. MixT can split
transactions across stores into sub-transactions at each of the stores. MixT has
4 components : a compiler, library, tracking mechanisms and support utilities.

# Interesting Points :

The use of C++17 is interesting. Rarely do systems paper take advantage of the
newer versions of languages. Is constexpr C++ a part of C++17 or is it a
different thing? I like the implementation section for the depth it goes in,

The results section is promising, with a constant delay for tracking. The
authors demonstrate that they have much better performance than weak consistency
. I wonder how mixing strong and causal would do as compared to purely causal.

# Research Level Question :

Can mixing transactions be avoided in most cases? Can the system default to
higher consistency level if needed for critical sections? This seems like a
significant complexity overhead. Can we avoid doing it?

# Closing Thoughts :

I really liked this paper. It was well written, the performance comparisons were
useful, and the implementation section goes in-depth about their decisions which
is very helpful.
