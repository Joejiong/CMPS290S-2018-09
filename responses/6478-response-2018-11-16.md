# CMPS 290S Reading Response: Logic and Lattices for Distributed Programming

## Summary
This paper discusses extensions to Bloom to accommodate lattices in multiple domains. The paper then describes the various details to be accounted for as part of the extension: how does CALM extend to lattices, how are lattices defined and used in set-oriented logic, how do built-in lattices work, etc.

## Learning and Understanding
There were a few points of discussion that were brought up during Peter's guest appearance that are relevant to this paper. One of the things mentioned was the relationship between morphisms and monotonic functions. This paper says that morphisms are monotonic, but monotonic functions are not necessarily morphisms.

I felt that figure 5 and the discussion of performance didn't seem useful. It is already claimed that the necessary changes were minimal, and for the transitive closure of a graph it would seem that Bloom<sup>L</sup> would be able to use just about identical code as Bloom. So, the addition of this in the paper seemed odd to me.


## Research Question and What to Investigate
I feel that an aspect of evaluation that never seems to come up is something of an HCI approach: given a task and maybe some example code, ask a developer to implement the task and see how well it performs. As a follow up evaluation, have that person try to improve a sub-optimal implementation. Since this work on CALM and bloom takes a different approach to addressing monotonicity compared to CRDTs, and because the whole point of CRDTs and CALM is to make writing distributed programs easier (I think), it seems like usability or programmability should be an important aspect of evaluation.
