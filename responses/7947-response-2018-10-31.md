# Paper: "Disciplined Inconsistency with Consistency Types"

#### Authors: Holt et al.

## Summary

The paper describes problems with consistency when writing programs. The idea introduced in the paper is of enforcing consistency via design of data types. The route that the authors attempt to take is to force the users to be aware of and specify the levels of inconsistency that the developer is prepared to accept. The IPA model does this by allowing consistency specification to become part of type usage.   

## Comments

1. A thought that came to mind while reading this paper (stating the obvious, of course): consistency and concurrency are problems that affect program design. Most authors take the approach to type design to handle these problems as opposed to creating languages because the ideas can easily be implemented in any language that allows type creation (which is all of them).  


2. Unlike latency policy I had a harder time understanding the accuracy policy. How do we know when we are in an inconsistent state? When we say `ErrorTolerance(5%)` on an integer type do we not have to know the actual value of the instanct to verify if there is an error in the value, and if we know the actual value why would we return anything else? 

In case of counters it is easy to see; the counter knows its current value and can compute error on new values of the counter. This system of error tolerance is valid for systems where there is  astrict order to how the values of the type are updated. This is an implicit understanding while creating policies on the type. I'm not sure if type policies could be enforced on types where there is no implicit understanding on how a value of a type will be updated, for eg. enforcing error tolerance on a primitive type. 

3. In the paper the authors restricted themselevs to working with numerical types, the system of type design and policies can easily work on numerical types but how do we extend them to work in types such as strings? Can we not assume a string to be a list of integers and apply the latency and error tolerance policies? 


## Research Ideas

This paper provoked thought on if there can be language semantics that can help with the problem of consistency in data values within a language (language provided semantics to deal with consistency). Most languages provide such semantics when dealing with concurrency (channels in Go or enforced immutability in functional languages). Can a language deal with consistency without worrying about the context of how the its types will be used?
