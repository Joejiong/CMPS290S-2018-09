# Response to "Consistency in Non-Transactional Distributed Storage Systems"

#### Authors: Paulo Viotti, Marko Vukolic 

## Summary

The paper is a survey of consistency models in distributed storage systems. The paper surveys 50 consistency models (I did not count to verify) which appeared in papers discussing consistency. I found it interesting that they grouped similar consistency models together to segregate them and describe their similarities and differences in a section. The first part of the paper defines and describes properties used to reason about the consistency models that the paper surveys. I found this quite helpful as these abstractions help define and differentiate consistency models more concretely than if mere descriptions were used. Some ideas previously discussed such as linearizability, serializability and sequential consistency are now much better understood. 

The paper is a good example of how survey papers should be especially when discussing ideas which at first glance have subtle differences between them but can also be represented mathematically. Ever since we encountered the consistency hierarchy in class, I was thinking of how do we classify strengths of consistency models. This paper gave some ideas on how we might begin.

## Questions

While going through the paper, I was trying to understand if the consistency models depicted laterally in Fig. 1 (Hierarchy of non-transactional consistency models), could be equivalent. No comment is made on the lateral placement on consistency models and we might consider them different from each other, however, can something be said about their lateral placements.
