## Summary

The authors propose new consistency models which can offer certain 
guarantees per user session. The 4 levels mentioned in this paper are :

- Read Your Write : If you perform a read on the same object after you write
to it, you are guaranteed that the read will reflect your write.

- Monotonic Reads : If you perform multiple reads on an object, you are 
guaranteed that the reads will reflect a non decreasing set of writes,
you can only go forward in time at each read.

- Writes follow reads : Writes do not happen until the reads that precede
them complete.

- Monotonic Writes : Writes only happen as a monotonically increasing set,
following writes that precede them.
 
These conditions can be implemented by creating write sets and read sets,
monotonically increasing sets which have uniquely numbered writes.

Implementations : 

- Read your write : System checks that for a server S, the write set is a 
subset of the database of S at time t. 

- Monotonic reads : System checks if read set is subset of the DB. 

- Monotonic writes : Write order is maintained from the servers point of 
view, and needs to be propagated to other servers.

- Writes follow reads : Any reads are performed before writes to the same
object.

## Interesting Points

The implementation and concept of these techniques seems very similar to
other techniques that were employed later : CRDTs and logical monotonicity.
Did this paper inspire that field of research?

I think these session level guarantees are much more practical, to implement
and offer than the others we have seen so far. These conditions seem obvious
yet the work needed to offer them in a distributed system speaks about the
fundamental complexity of these systems.

## Research level question

Why is an alternate condition : reads follow writes not discussed? 
Suppose you want to guarantee that any read will only return the most 
up-to-date data, you could offer the condition that any pending writes will
be performed and reads will be pushed back. I can think of some applications
where you would want the most recent state even at the cost of delays.

## Closing thoughts

I really liked this paper. It is well written, the examples are clear, it
is easy to read and understand. Overall I enjoyed reading this paper.
(It has 0 pictures though, so 7/10)
