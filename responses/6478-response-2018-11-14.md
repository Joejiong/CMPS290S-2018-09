# CMPS 290S Reading Response: Consistency Analysis in Bloom: A CALM and Collected Approach

## Summary
This paper connects the CALM principle with **B**loom **U**nder **D**evelopment (BUD). The CALM principle claims that **c**onsistency **a**nd **l**ogical **m**onotonicity are tightly connected--logically monotonic regions of a program are guaranteed to be consistent despite *temporal nondeterminism*. Temporal nondeterminism means that the semantics of time will be different from operation to operation, which can simply be viewed as there is no guarantee that operation ordering for some set of operations will be the same over many repetitions. Using this principle, the motivation is that computer architecture (the von Neumann architecture) has certain ordering assumptions implicit in the programming model. A declarative language, like Bloom, is thus more naturally suited to developing for distributed systems because there are fewer notions of ordering embedded in set-oriented programming models such as SQL and Bloom.

## Learning and Understanding
I didn't know the bloom syntax before, but I now understand it much much better. I think this is also one of the few papers by Peter I haven't read.


## Research Question and What to Investigate
I wonder about some of the subtleties of timesteps. Does everything in bloom happen within a timestep, or is a timestep just meant to be a proxy for loosely reasoning about when data exists in bloom, without having to think about when operations occur?
