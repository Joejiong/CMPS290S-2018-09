# Response to "Orleans: Clould Computing for Everyone"

#### Authors: Bykov et al.

## Summary

The Orleans framework aims to provide programming abstractions for scalable distributed software. It provides an actor based programming language. The programming model itself is aynchronous where calls return with a promise of future response. One of the main aims of the model is to be programmer friendly and provide features in the programming language that allow the programs to scale without making the users writing code for scalability, reliability and availability.

Few of the key ideas in Orleans are "Grains" which define programming units of execution, grains instances can be instantiated via activations, grains can modify and reconcile data in persistent state shared by activations.


## Things I liked

The ideas of grains, activations, promises and turns are very intuitive to understanding program execution in distribtuted systems. 

## Comments

The programming model is slightly complicated by the concept of promises. The programmer has to write code to handle these responses. This is similar to the concept event handlers in P but I feel that the syntax in Orleans is a bit more complicated than in P.

One of the references was Barabara Liskov's paper fom which the concept of Promises probably was borrowed. The paper brings interesting concepts in distributed computing together to build an interesting programming model.
