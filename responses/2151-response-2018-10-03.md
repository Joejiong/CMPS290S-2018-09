CAP Twelve Years Later: 

The CAP theorem states that any networked shared-data system can have at most two of three desirable properties; consistency, availability, and partitions. Choosing consistency and availability between a set of nodes means forfeiting partition between those nodes. However, it is not possible to preserve both consistency and availability without these nodes communicating, thus forfeiting partition is not an option.  This proof doesn’t mean a developer have to choose between consistency or availability, instead they can optimize both by explicitly handling partitions especially that partitions are considered rare. This is easier to see when think of all three properties  are more continuous than binary. This means a developer can have a flexibility in determining the level of consistency and availability they want to achieve for their system needs.

However, to optimize both availability and consistency, a developer must come up with a strategy that can detect and manage partitions and recover from them. For example, a system can have a prefect availability and consistency until a partition is detected. Once a partition is detected, a developer can choose between availability and consistency, not necessary for the whole operations but some of them depending on the invariants that the system must maintains. Once, the partition is healed, the system restore consistency and compensate for any mistakes were made during the partition. It is important for each system to track history of operations during a partition. This can be done using vectors clocks which provide causal consistency between the systems. 

It is important for the developer during a recovery from a partition to make sure all systems states are consistent and compensate for any mistakes made during the partition. The paper suggested different ways on handling conflicts between system during recovery. For example, certain conflicts can be resolved by the user manually if the system is not able to revoel them. Another way is to resolve them based on the type of operation such as in Google Docs. 

Before compensating for mistakes made during the partitions, a system must able to detect which invariants have been violated after a recovery. This enable a designer to create different recovery strategies for different invariants violations. 

Some things I didn’t understand from reading the paper is what define a partition? can a partition happen at the client side count as a partition in the system? In terms of the research question, what is the model that can be used to develop strategies to compensate for invariants violation.
