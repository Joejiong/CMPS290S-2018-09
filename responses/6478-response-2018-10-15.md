# Summary
Lloyd, Freedman, et al. detail a consistency model that is stronger than causal consistency, weaker than sequential consistency, yet scalable. The consistency model, causal **+ convergent conflict handling** consistency, adds mechanisms to allow for conflicts to be handled in a convergent (can be merged) way. The authors also describe the types of applications that this consistency model is designed for: **A**vailable, low **L**atency, **P**artition tolerant, and **S**calable (ALPS). Interestingly, the authors mention that convergent conflict handling isn't a property that they first found, but that they have defined this strengthening of causal consistency in a way that is scalable.
