# Summary
Viotti and Vukolic surveyed over 50 consistency semantics (or models) to understand how all of these semantics relate to each other. They created a diagram showing the partial ordering of these consistency semantics, which range from weak consistency to linearizability (strong consistency). In one section, they describe their semantics and terminology in order to coalesce other consistency semantics into the same semantic notation, and then in a following section they provide their analysis of the consistency semantics and compare their strengths in order to determine the actual partial ordering and an additional, loosely-defined clustering of consistency semantics into families.
