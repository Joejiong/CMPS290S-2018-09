This paper is about applying the concept of _monotonicity_ to analysis of distributed
programs. Monotonicity in this context is the property that no results from the system are
ever _revoked_ (any statement that's known to be true under monotonic logic continues to
be true as new facts are added to the system).

In a distributed system, verifying this property in a computation lets you know that you
don't need to synchronise to produce results, you can just produce results “as you get
them”. This captures streaming logic (`map render`) as well as computations on aggregates
that can produce an answer that won't change as more data comes in (`min . (<100)`).

This provides a somewhat more general property than commutative updates—CRDTs are all
monotonic data structures, but not all monotonic structures are CRDTs (I think?)

If your program isn't wholly monotonic, then you can at least pinpoint the executions that
are non-monotonic, and apply targeted synchronisation there. Monotonic logic apparently manages to provide fewer instances of synchronisation under these analyses than “traditional” read/write analysis. (i.e., information flow analysis?)

Bloom, then, is a declarative dataflow language implemented on top of Ruby,
that incorporates a lot of SQL's relational logic. It has its concept of tables (that
persist across timesteps) and scratch collections (that don't; which is how I suppose we
avoid cluttering state in the monotonic logic system with
`t_34234_old_no_longer_relevant_fact`). Facts get inserted into and swallowed from scratch
collections to represent network behaviour.

The design also provides many ways for code organization; it seems to compose perfectly
well with Ruby's systems. In particular, there's some special casing with the names of
different interfaces so that (as far as I can tell) their behaviour across mixins appears
to mimic the behaviour of standard Ruby constructs.

The underlying logic behind this (Daedalus?) looks interesting; I wish we talked about it
more.

The dependency diagrams actually feel less readable to me than the code itself, which is
probably a good marker of the language.
