## Response: 'From Clarity to Efficiency for Distributed Algorithms'

### Summary

<p align="justify">
The paper presents DistAlgo which is a high-level language designed to provide descriptive pseudocode, formal specification languages and programming languages. The authors then explain the syntax of the language which can then be incorporated into object-oriented languages like Java and Python.

### Learning
<p align="justify">
There is nothing new in the paper. Infact, I did not enjoy reading it much. Programming related syntax explained in the paper is trivial and I have already used this in Java for distributed programming.

### What’s a research-level question I have after having read this paper?
<p align="justify">
I dont have any research level question for DistAlgo. But I will be interested in exploring other distributed programming languages like Erlang, Scala or Clojure.
