## Response: 'From Clarity to Efficiency for Distributed Algorithms'

### Summary

<p align="justify">
The paper presents DistAlgo which is a high-level language designed to provide descriptive pseudocode, formal specification languages and programming languages. The authors then explain the syntax of the language which can then be incorporated into object-oriented languages like Java and Python. The paper talks about incrementalization which transforms expensive computations using quantifications into aggregate queries.

### Understanding
<p align="justify">
The authors claim that "each resulting aggregate query result can be obtained in O(1) time and incrementally maintained in O(1) time per update." For running aggregate query for each element of the set still requires O(n) for entire set computation. So how is this an improvement? 
  
The paper mentions about yield points but what exactly is the main benefit of using it? What is its functionality?
</p>
<p align="justify">
There is nothing new in the paper. Programming related syntax explained in the paper is trivial.

### What’s a research-level question I have after having read this paper?
<p align="justify">
I dont have any research level question for DistAlgo as such. But I am interested in exploring other distributed programming languages like Erlang or Scala which have built-in message passing between processes/threads.
