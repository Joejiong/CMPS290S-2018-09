# From Clarity to Efficiency for Distributed Algorithms

Yanhong A. Liu, Scott D. Stoller, Bo Lin, Michael Gorbovitski

## Summary

The authors present DistAlgo a high level language that allows 'natural'
expression of Distributed Systems constructs in a programmable way. DistAlgo
extends Python, Java to allow :

- Processes as objects
- Yields and control-flow waits
- Message handling
- Synchronization
- Message History

and various other techniques.

The authors point out that control flow waits could cause the program to be
delayed exponentially and message histories may result in garbage collection
nightmares. The authors explain their incremental approach to addressing this
problem.

_Incrementalization_ turns expensive operations smaller incremental operations
which act on values. This involves operations like converting nested queries
into equivalent aggregate queries using defined riles. The authors state various
rules for converting loops and conditionals into comparisons and aggregates.

This improves performance and reduces space complexity significantly, especially
in case of nested conditionals.

This performs an information-flow like algorithm, converting queries into
subqueries, and storing results along the way (memoization) to turn the
execution incremental instead of conditional.

They implement DistAlgo in Python, and implement a variety of algorithms in it.

## Interesting Points

The comparison between the code sizes seems pointless to me, since once compiled
distalgo programs become much bigger anyway. Some of the other languages can
directly run the programs as they are.

I wonder why they implemented Raft a year later and not at the time of this
paper.

The memory and time comparisons are interesting esp. Paxos vs other types of
Paxos, but how do they compare to say a native paxos implementation in Python?
Also I am not convinced that Python is the right implementation choice for this
project since Python has a lot of limitations (multiprocessing/memory/type)
which are enforced by the global interpreter.

## Research level question

I am not convinced by the efficiency part. Distalgo specs nail the clarity,
but unless they are talking about code efficiency, an implementation extending
Python will not be the best idea.

What are some good languages which support implementations of DSL through built
in features? I know that bloom uses Ruby, and Haskell or Scala or other
functional languages seem to be the go to choice for experimentation with types,
rust for safety, prolog for logic programming paradigms.
