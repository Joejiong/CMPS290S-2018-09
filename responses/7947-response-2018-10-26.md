# Paper: "Cloud Types for Eventual Consistency"

#### Authors: Burckhardt et al.

## Summary:

The main aim of the authors is the creation of data types compatible with the rapidly changing environment of the cloud. The authors go about doing this from the perspective of programming language design, specifically the type system of a language which would be used to develop applications where data could be stored remotely. The authors go on to define the features of the types and how they might be used in programs. A few programs are also included to help understand the system of using Cloud types in a programs.

Cloud data types are designed to be eventually consistent and changes are tracked via a revision tree. The revision tree is similar to that used in any distributed version control system. There are remote copies of the revision tree and local copies of a revision tree during merge the state information is exchanged and the data moves towards eventual consistency.

The data types introduced were both primitive types (integer, strings) and structured types ( arrays and objects).

In many of the programs functionality was implemented which already exists in programming languages of the time. NaiveReserve, SubmitOrder, can be implemented in any programming language of the day, so is the contribution of the paper boils down to two ideas:
1. How to hide details of distributed object maintainance from the user.
2. How to ensure that the distributed objects are eventually consistent (and even how to have strong consistency in the types).

(ASIDE: I'm somehow not impressed by the paper's title including "Cloud", it should have been just "Distributed data types" and it would have made more sense as the concept is applicable to any distributed type system.)

## Questions and doubts:

There are a few doubts in the paper on which I needed clarifications:

1. The authors define "yield" on pp 287-88 as a mechanism that basically takes care of merges between remote and local data. But go on to say that "the absence of a yield guarantees isolation and atomicity". I didn't quite understand how the yield statement does that.

2. This paper was published in 2012. There were already systems available that were allowing remote data access but the paper completely ignored them. If I have versioned data store available to me, an ORM API to query data from that data store and generate an appropriate representation for my data, and I add the yeild, FJA mechanism to my data type, then would I have not implemented the paper? The first two are already available to me in 2012.

Something the authors should have mentioned:

1. The paper did not include references to systems like DryadLINQ[1], or CORBA[2] which also have a goal of maintaining distributed objects and provide a programming language interface to the objects. 

## Research Ideas:

The paper discussed the idea of hiding implementation of distributed types from the user, allowing for a more working system that can be implemented in any programming language. Yet, I don't see this being used anywhere.  One project that came out of this research was Microsoft's TouchDevelop but that seems to have been abandoned now. Is it because of speed of the program executions? If not what could be other reasons for not adopting cloud types? An implementation of cloud types would be an interesting research project.
