# Response to "P: Safe Asynchronous Event-Driven Programming"

#### Authors: Desai et al.

## Summary

The authors discuss P, an event-driven programming language. The aim of the designers was to create a language which could help write reliable software. The programming language itself aims to implement a state machine. The compiler and runtime help validate the state machine so that error and flaws in the program can be more formally analysed and corrected.

## Things I liked

The idea of building a programming language whose first class citizens are borrowed directly from state machine literature is great. P is a programming language which has already been used in production software which further strengthens its position as a viable programming language. The idea of using state machines also helps achieves one of the aims of the programming language which was the ability to create tools that can reason about the programs in the language and allow for a better formal verification process. Bugs can be caught easily as programmers reason only about things that can happen in the state.

## Questions

1. Although the programmers can reason about events in the programs they write what programmers can still screw up the software if they were not able to write proper event handlers. So there is still some level of things that cannot be solved by the state machine model.

2. Code complexity can exponentially increase when new features or states are added to a program. This can happen in code written in C/C++ or any other programming model as well but one criticism that I've read about event driven programming languages is their lack of extensibility. Sure, we can write USB drivers in P, but can the language be used to write large software systems and still manage the complexity that comes with increased number of states? I'm not sure if this is a valid criticism of the language. But it is worthwhile to consider the design of P as a direct implementation of the state machine model.

## Comments

The ideas presented in the paper are pretty cool. The idea of event driven programming is not new (virtually every UI framework uses it), the idea of using the state machine as a formal verification tool and writing reliable software using the model seems pretty interesting.

## Ideas

It would be interesting to see if there is any way to quantify or qualify program complexity  when new features are added to the program and compare the same to judge if the language model contributes to the complexity. Right now the critiques of the event-driven programming model seem very subjective.
