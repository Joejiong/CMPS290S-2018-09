# Response to "Conflict-free Replicated Data Types"

#### Authors: Shapiro et al. 

## Summary

Initially, I found the paper a bit dense and decided to checkout resources online [1], [2], [3], which discussed the idea behind CRDTs. With that background I went back to the paper and found it much easier to follow. The main idea is that CRDTs are not really a data type rather a set of properties which when implemented for any data objects allows the object to be replicated and become strongly eventually consistent. The paper defines strong eventual consistency and presents two classes of CRDTs which are strongly eventually consistent.  

I also found the examples of how to use CRDTs very useful, especially the example of the directed graph.

I felt that the paper could have benefited with a few more examples of objects with CRDT properties. 

One big takeaway for me from this paper was that commutativity, associativity and idempotency are extrememly useful when thinking of solving problems of replication in a distributed system. 

## Questions

I felt that some of the notation in the paper was a bit confusing and hard to follow.

Are there any properties other than commutativity, associativity and idempotence which can also be used to build CRDTs?

## Developing the ideas

The first thing I'm interested in is implementing a CRDT example (especially the DAG presented in the paper). I would like to expolre more recent work on CRDTs especially their performance in distributed systems and alternatives to CRDTs.
