## Response: 'Don’t Settle for Eventual: Scalable Causal Consistency for Wide-Area Storage with COPS'

### Summary

The paper itself mentions that it is the first one to introduce causal+ consistency which is a combination of two properties: causal consistency and convergent conflict handling. The paper discusses design and implementation of COPS (Clusters of Order-Preserving Servers) which provides four properties—availability, low Latency, partition-tolerance, and high scalability (ALPS).

The paper defines convergent conflict handling in which all conflicting writes have to be handled in the same manner at all replicas, using a handler function. There are various ways of resolving these conflicts like ‘last-write wins’ or mark them as conflicting events which is then resolved by users. In order to provide causal consistency, there are two abstractions in COPS system: version and dependencies.

All operations are first performed at local datacenter and simultaneously written to a single log in serialized order, marked with a version vector. Different replicas then exchange these logs and by using version vectors they establish potential causality and detect concurrency between operations at different replicas. The main crux of COPS system is maintaining the entire dependency graph which can result in a lot of overhead. The authors introduce another implementation called COPS-GT where the system keeps old versions of key-value pairs along with most recent writes, to ensure that it can provide get transactions.

### What’s one thing I learned?
Convergent conflict handling is a new concept for me.

### What’s something I didn’t understand?
There is an example discussed in the paper where they use execution thread rule. Did not understand that clearly.

### What’s a research-level question I have after having read this paper?
How exactly these dependency graphs are maintained across wide-area distributed systems provided network partitions exist??

### What’s a concrete step I can take toward answering the research question?
Understand the COPS and COPS-GT system in-detail.
