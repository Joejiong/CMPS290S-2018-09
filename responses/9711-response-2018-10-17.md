This paper is a overall survey of consistency models that aims to clear up the often thrown around term. They focus specifically on consistency models used in storage and distributed systems research and provide an ordering based on the strength (an incredibly vague term) of the consistency models. They do limit their survey to non-transactional semantics. They start off by discussing some of the theoretical background of consistency and mentions of negative results like FLP and CAP. They reference Peter’s programming languages papers in this one. So that is cool. Although they don’t particularly well define what exactly the “strength” of a consistency model actual is. They do though relate consistency semantics for the models to a real world examples. They use a common distributed systems model to reason about different consistency models. This distributed system uses the familiar (at least by now in the course) concepts of histories, executions, processes, concurrency, and operations. After defining these concept the authors present us with the familiar nightmare inducing flowchart that has haunted my dreams for the past fortnight. They start with linearizability and strong consistency and present a quick example and some formal semantic definitions. This is followed by eventual/weak consistency with the same definitions given. For eventual consistency we are given a few properties, eventual delivery, convergence, and termination. An addition constraint of strong convergence is also added. PRAM (also called FIFO) and sequential consistency come next with a single example. Session guarantees as presented in the Terry et al. Bayou paper are given with the four different guarantees used in Bayou. In addition to these we also are given formalized definitions for Causal, Staleness-based, Fork-based, Composite and tunable, and per object models. Most of the rest of the paper is then related work and references.


What I took away from this paper is a better comparison of the different consistency models which helps me reason about their relationships to one another. What I still don’t quite understand is the notion of “strength”. I somewhat intrinsically know what is meant by it but it still feels very amorphous and vague without a better definition. Also I found many of the so called real-world examples a bit lacking. It may be a rather obvious question to come up with after reading this paper is does consistency really have to be this complicated? From a systems designer perspective the paper seems rather invaluable as a reference as it concisely presents each model in a formalized manner. Also being a more systems oriented person I must ask if it is possible to have a head to head performance evaluation of these different consistency models in real world systems. As the papers for each of them claim performance gains in a specific use case as a motivation. It would seem to me that one way to compare them that isn’t entirely obvious in its methodology, is to run a performance analysis.
