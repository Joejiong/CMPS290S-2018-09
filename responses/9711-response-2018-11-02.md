Disclaimer, I didnâ€™t read this too thoroughly as I had a midterm exam today that I was studying for.

In this paper the authors tackle the problem of programmers requesting stronger consistency either too much or too little therefore leading to performance or correctness issues in a database system. In order to solve this issue they present a few proofs and rules to help programmers reason about consistency. First is a rule to show that a given choice of guarantees will preserve a data invariant. They automated that in an SMT solver based tool. They present the idea of database anomalies arising during execution of database operations but also say that these anomalies should not violate certain integrity invariants pertaining to the data being modified. The paper focuses on hybrid consistency models and provides rules for when and where one can perform different operations on a database. For instance with causal consistency they provide rules for when the programmer must perform operations in a synchronous manner via something the authors call a conflict relation. From this they can put together a modular proof rule that will allow the programmer to preserve invariants. In addition to the original state based proof rule they present there is also an event based rule that proves to be a bit more general from which one can derive the state based rule (reminds me of state and operation based CRDTs). Interestingly they use off the shelf SMT tools. I am all for using existing solutions or tools over developing yet another variant. I got completely lost in the formal semantics section. What the heck is figure 6? It looks like something out of a physics paper.

What I did not understand from this paper is most of the pictures. With many programming languages focused papers I look to figures to help me understand what is going on as the semantic rules are often a brick wall of confusing text until one analyzes them long enough. The biggest culprit of confusion for me is figure 6. What I did learn from this paper, is a clearer picture of hybrid consistency methods in databases. Although I will have to read this again more thoroughly in order to maximize these gains. To be perfectly honest here I am lost as to a research question or concrete steps towards solving a question but that issue will likely be solved when I ruminate on this paper a bit more and see the presentation in class today.
