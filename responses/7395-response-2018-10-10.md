## Response: 'Time, Clocks, and the Ordering of Events in a Distributed System'

### Summary
This is the original paper which introduced the concept of Lamport(Logical) clocks for ordering events or operations in a distributed environment. The paper discussed ‘happened before’ event which defines partial ordering and presented a distributed algorithm for extending it to a total ordering of events. The authors then introduced the algorithm which comprises of few rules. 

The interesting thing about the distributed algorithm is that each process independently follows these rules, and there is no central synchronizing process or shared storage. Moreover, this approach can be generalized to implement any level of synchronization for a distributed multiprocess system. The paper showed a few scenarios where this resource scheduling algorithm can behave anonymously. To tackle this behavior, the paper then explains how physical time clocks can coordinate the events.

### What’s one thing I learned?
Lamport clock is an interesting concept and how it can be used for ordering events in distributed systems.

### What’s something I didn’t understand?
Overall, I understood the paper but yes still trying to understand the proof given in the paper.

### What’s a research-level question I have after having read this paper?
Really interested in knowing how distributed systems adapted the Lamport timestamp after this paper got introduced in 1978.

### What’s a concrete step I can take toward answering the research question?
Reading papers on distributed systems and how they integrated Lamport timestamp after it got introduced.
