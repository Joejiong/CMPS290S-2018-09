# Brewerâ€™s Conjecture and the Feasibility of Consistent, Available, 
# Partition-Tolerant Web Services

## Summary

This paper goes in depth about Brewer's conjecture, presented as a talk which 
states it is impossible to have :

- Consistency : Atomic or linearizable consistency : 
the changes will be indistinguishable from the same steps executed on a 
single threaded execution.

- Availability : Every request must terminate in a bounded time.

- Partition Tolerance : Every node must respond to requests, even if messages 
are lost in case of a network partition.

at the same time in web services. If you relax one of the conditions, 
it is possible to guarantee the other two. 

The paper goes on to prove this by contradiction for the case of asynchronous 
networks, and further extends it to partially synchronous networks.

## Interesting Points

I found their definition of availability very interesting, it preempted the 
question about "is delay a failure" which is something we discussed in 
distributed systems. 

I liked their approach of proving it for an asynchronous model and 
then extending the proof to partially synchronous model. The paper 
predicts the rise of weaker consistency models and NoSQL.

## Questions

Why are the Consistency, Availability, and Partition tolerance (CAP) the 
only 3 conditions considered? Distributed systems and web services are 
complex, and often need to meet specific targets. While CAP are useful for 
consistency and availability, they put no bounds on performance or the t
ime to service a request. WHich in some cases could be more important. 

The rise in popularity of NoSQL databases despite offering very weak guarantees 
(because throughput/ latency) shows that for a large number of applications, 
performance is a much more important metric than consistency.

It looks to me as Performance as a P could fit in this conjecture too. 
You can guarantee performance and availability at the cost of consistency (NoSQL). 
You could have high availability and consistency but performance will suffer. 
Performance and consistency appear hard to achieve without a synchronous system 
which leads us to :

## Research level question

Were it possible to have a completely synchronous network 
(within some bounds) would it be possible to get CAP?

## Answer : Perhaps (with limitations)

Google Spanner [1] : Google's "synchronously-replicated" database Spanner 
uses atomic clocks to keep global time and an API which exposes the time
 uncertainity in the system. This can then be used to ensure strong 
 consistency, high availability and horizontal scaling with some level of 
 partition tolerance. It also offers high performance as well as a SQL 
 RDBMS-like table format, branding itself as "NewSQL."

## Closing thoughts

The paper presents a very interesting conjecture : strong Consistency, 
high Availability, and strong tolerance to network partitions is impossible 
to achieve. While this is an interesting observation, there are doubts over i
ts utility in designing systems, which is what it was intended for. 
(It is interesting, and somewhat true, but *is it actually useful?*)

The critique of CAP [2] offers an interesting insight into the contradictions 
of the paper. The terms CAP are not well defined. It doesn't take into account 
performance (or latency as discussed in this paper) and nodes crashing in an 
available, partition tolerant system could cause loss of availability, which is 
not something the authors take into account. The critique proposes a delay-sensitive 
framework using latency as an important factor to propose an alternative.
