## Response: 'P: Safe Asynchronous Event-Driven Programming'

### Summary

<p align="justify">
Summary
The paper introduces P which is an asynchronous event-driven programming language. The programmers achieve flexibility by designing the system as a collection of state machines. The interesting feature of P is the use of ghost state machines to verify and handle fault tolerance.

### Learning
<p align="justify">
Whenever I read a P/L paper, the first question that comes to my mind is  “implementation of the language in current distributed systems”. I personally liked P as it is being used in production by Microsoft. Also, the concept of using state machines for event handling and verification is an interesting idea.

### Research Question

Research Questions
</p>
1.  As mentioned in the paper, “The number of states and executions of a P program is unbounded”. Currently, P is being used for USD drivers. How about using it for some large distributed system? How to control state explosion for such systems?
2.  P being an event-driven language makes it suitable for interactive applications where client response is critical. Has P been considered for such applications?
