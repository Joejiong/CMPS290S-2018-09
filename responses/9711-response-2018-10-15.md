This paper builds on the one we read previously concerning causal consistency and introduces a new consistency model that essentially adds convergent conflict handling to causal consistency. They implement this in a key value store that the authors call COPS. The present another acronym called ALPS ( availability, low latency, partition tolerance, and scalability), why is it that the acronyms in these papers never make complete sense? The idea presented is that the authors want the strongest consistency possible in an ALPS compliant system. Much like causal consistency the system handles causal relationships between different operations. The convergent conflict handling makes sure that replicas in a distributed datastore never diverge permanently.  The authors give us two versions of their implementation. One that gives consistency between individual pieces of data and another that provides consistent get transactions across multiple keys (not quite sure why that is exciting). The no locks, no blocking part of that does sound more intriguing but man are they kind of pretentious about it. They provide a list of desirable characteristics for an ALPS system of which they really emphasize scalability (linear complexity), stronger consistency that eventual, and latency. In the definition of causal+ they cover many of the same points as causal consistency (which many of the same confusing notation). The interesting bit being about convergent conflict handling that sets the requirement that all puts be handled the same on all replicas. The handler must therefore be associative and commutative and uses the last-write-wins rule. They then go into the implementation and design of COPS and COPS-GT. I took interest more in their garbage collection. The evaluation is rather solid and one can definitely repeat their experiments. The performance numbers are well put together and something I have sorely missed from previous papers. Although they mention the system LOG in their evaluation section I don’t see it present in any of their performance benchmarks. Also I feel it would have been considerably stronger of an evaluation if they compared their system to something like an eventual consistency based one. 

What I did learn from this paper is the existence of convergent conflict handling, which I think is the really interesting part of the paper. Other than that the paper really likes blowing its own horn but sections like the introduction were somewhat badly written. What I did not understand was why they acted like they had solved consistency issues forever. Too much hype for what I see as an incremental improvement on causal consistency. Table 1 is useless. I thought the ideas were solid but the presentation left me with a bad taste in my mouth. Is there a good system that uses normal causal consistency or eventual consistency to compare this to? A lot of these papers don’t seem to compare themselves to the competitors. As a proponent of experimental results I am very much so tempted to spin all these things up myself and test it. Also I don’t exactly believe that causal+ is the best that one can get in terms of strong consistency in an ALPS system and want to know what benefits if any can be made via compromising a little bit on some of the ALPS guarantees.
