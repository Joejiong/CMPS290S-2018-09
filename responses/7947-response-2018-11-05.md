# Response to "MixT: A Language for Mixing Consistency in Geodistributed Transactions"

#### Authors: Matthew Milano and Andrew Myers

## Summary

I liked the paper. The authors discussed how different consistency models could be used in transactions using information flow types. Some problems dealt with in the paper include:

1. If I define a set of types and wishes to have some consistency model associated with the type, how do I go about creating such a type?
2. How do I enforce consistency relationships on data and interactions between data which enforce different consistency models?
3. How do I create a system that can check violations or conflicts in mixed consistency programs at compile time?

## Questions

* This is something that is bugging me: Why is something (consistency guarantees) that should be provided by a storage unit (db/datastore) being provided by DSLs? Wouldn't it be better if the DB provided an interface to specify how data ought to be stored and accessed (the consistency guarantee which should be associated with the data)? If a db were to provide an interface that would allow users to access data with the consistency guarantee with which it was stored and take care of maintaining consistency guarantees internally, would that make MixT redundant?

  * One possible answer I could think of is that the most databases right now do not provide different consistency guarantees on the data. MixT (and other DSLs which attempt to enforce some form of mixed consistency) is a response to this.
  * Another possible answer is that even if the DB could enforce data specific consistency models, MixT way of enforcing consistency at compile time is still required because if not, we end up with the same problem of incorrect programs.

* For MixT to work the underlying datastore must provide some form consistency guarantee. Can linearizability be enforced by MixT programs if the underlying datastore supports only eventual consistency? From the examples in Figure 10 seems to suggest, yes.
