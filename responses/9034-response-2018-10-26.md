# Cloud Types for Eventual Consistency

Sebastian Burckhardt, Manuel Fähndrich, Daan Leijen, and Benjamin P. Wood

## Summary

The author's introduce new mechanisms for ensuring eventual consistency in
cloud based mechanisms. They start with the example of cellular telephone 
applications (or as we call them in the 21st century, mobile apps). These 
apps can often spend long times disconnected from the network, to save 
data, and battery. This means apps have local replicas of the data which are
periodically synced to the server. This poses various consistency challenges
and a need for conflict resolution. 

How do "achieve eventual consistency (that) is daunting even for experts"?
Cloud Types™ to the rescue! The authors introduce cloud types, which support
integer, string and even complex operations such as arrays and sets while
supporting primitives that make programming for the oft-disconnected cloud
easier and make it possible to achieve eventual consistency. 

The model they propose for resolving conflicts is similar to the fork-join
model that source control systems use. When you start a local operation, 
you fork the values from the server, operate on them and join the set of 
updates to the server when reconnected. This is achieved by logging updates
and what the authors describe as "revision diagrams". 

*Yield partitions* : The authors introduce the keyword _yield_ which is a
very interesting concept. The _yield_ is a non-blocking operation that 
promises to send all the updates to the server. But, interestingly, to be
non-blocking, it offers no guarantees on when the updates will be sent,
meaning, invoking _yield_ could perform no action at all. Where this helps
however, is in partitioning the code into transactions. You can be sure that
the actions between two yields will be performed locally in a session before
being sent to the server effectively as a transaction.


*Flush for writing* : But what if you want stronger than eventual 
consistency? You can _flush!_. Not dissimilar to the idea from cache flushes
flush is a blocking operation that blocks until the server is up to date
with your updates before proceeding. This can be useful in scenarios such
as banking operations or ticket sales. 

*Formal Semantics* : The cloud types are defined as Fork-Join Automatons,
adhering to the fork join model. The type ensures that operations occur
in a way that is resolveable for the fork-join semantics of the model.

For instance, in case of cloud integers : 

FJA (QUESfj)
Query, Update, States, Initial State, fork join

Cint FJA : (has 3 values) 

- bool update
- int base
- int offset

On Fork : 

- reset update = false
- base = current value
- offset = 0


set operation changes the base, and sets update = true

add only changes the offset


On Join :

- if update is true, base = that value
- add offset to the base
- base = the new value
- offset = 0

 
## Interesting Points

The authors make a rather bold claim that _"In particular, a correct and 
reliable implementation of the communication protocol and the conflict 
resolution to achieve eventual consistency is daunting even for experts."_
in the abstract. Yet they do not back that claim up with any data. The 
related work goes over the usual culprits, CRDTs and Transactions, but not
on approaches which solved these problems before 2012. Mobile apps have been
around since 1990s, and seemed to be doing just fine on consitency.

It is interesting that the paper looks at consistency from a programming
language point of view, and as something expressed by the programmer. This
pushes the responsibility of synchronization and consistency to the app
developer, rather than the architecture, which could make programming
harder and require developers to have a more in-depth knowledge of the 
interface. 

## Research level question

It seems to me, the problem solved by _flush_ is really similar to cache
line _flush_ used by systems programmers to ensure cache is flushed before
they perform any new updates. The use of cache flush is becoming 
increasingly common, specially in non-volatile memory systems, and it would
be interesting to see the similarities and differences between the 
approaches and whether there is techniques that can be used from either 
system in the other.

## Closing thoughts

The paper seemed a bit disorganized to me. Subsections don't necessarily 
relate to each other and may not be sub sections of the main section. 
The related work lacks a mobile app perspective, and this paper seems to
be torn between picking 3 intersecting domains : cloud, mobile, and 
distributed systems. Considering the quality of mobile apps, I feel like
making intelligent decisions about synchronizing should be left to the
system rather than the application developers. This was an interesting paper
to read, my critique should not be interpreted as a disapproval.
