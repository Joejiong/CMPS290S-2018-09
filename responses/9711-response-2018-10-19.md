This paper presents a now common method of approaching replicated data objects that provide strong eventual consistency guarantees. I am not quite sure where this lands with respect to previously covered data types as we didn’t get to talking about the different models on Wednesday. The authors call this approach Conflict-free Replicated Data Types. Which provide a guarantee that they will converge (I assume like causal+) even in the face of failed systems. They present two approaches, state and operation based CRDTs. The authors claim to avoid the issue of conflict resolution and rollbacks as present in normal eventual and I would assume an implementation of causal consistency. While also avoiding the need for synchronization and providing all the other bells and whistles that are kind of required to mention in distributed systems papers. In state based replication a given replica will periodically send its state to another replica where they are then merged (so a gossip protocol like in cassandra). The authors then present a nice formal definition of causal history and state based objects. Each update is considered delivered when it is included in the recipient’s causal history. The difference between Strong Eventual Consistency and Eventual consistency is given as the satisfaction of the “strong convergence” condition where “correct replicas that have delivered update have equivalent state” instead of “eventually reach equivalent state”.  With these definitions we get the definition for a state-based convergent replicate data type. Object based is defined as consisting of a tuple of “prepare update” and “effect update” methods. The object based equivalent is called a commutative replicated data type. They then present theorems and proofs for the equivalency of the two CRDT types presented, some minor examples of CRDTs, and a longer pseudocode laden thought experiment section involving a very thoroughly laid out directed graph construct that is backed up by a formal proof.

One question I have is where does strong eventual consistency land with respect to things like PRAM, sequential, and causal consistency? I somewhat scoff at them claiming that strong eventual consistency is a “solution” to the “CAP problem”. Especially given that they don’t back this up all that well (two non-technical paragraphs with no hard evidence). That is a very bold claim. They do a better job when explaining the relationship with sequential consistency. I didn’t learn much that was new from this paper but with each pass I pick up on more that I missed previously. What I still don’t quite understand is how exactly strong eventual consistency  is exactly “stronger”. I think I get the idea but it remains somewhat fuzzy and out of focus. As usual for me my research question involves finding more implementations and examples of their work to examine the validity of CRDT’s in real world applications. Also I really want to know if the authors back up their claims of solving the CAP problem in a later paper.

I am somewhat unsatisfied by the lack of implementation but the authors do state earlier that they implemented CRDTs in their previous paper about TreeDocs (still haven’t looked that up yet). The lack of a formal proof where they claim to solve the CAP problem and no experimental implementation in this paper leave me rather salty.

No matter how many times I read this paper (the count is now three) the Portuguese on page five always trips me up.
