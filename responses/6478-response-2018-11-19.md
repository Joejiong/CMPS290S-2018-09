# CMPS 290S Reading Response: From Clarity to Efficiency for Distributed Algorithms

## Summary
This paper proposes a programming language for distributed systems with simplified syntax that is easy for people to understand. The primary technical contribution of this language is the transformation of existential and universal quantifiers to incremental, monotonic computations. The described language is pythonic in syntax and very easy to read.

## Learning and Understanding
The use of incremental computation seems clearly space efficient because it minimizes the amount of state that must be maintained, but I am not sure how it is computationally any more efficient? The paper claims:

    In particular, each resulting aggregate query result can be obtained in O(1) time and incrementally
    maintained in O(1) time per update to the sets maintained and affected plus the time for evaluating
    the conditions in the aggregate query once per update
  
But I'm not sure how they can consider it to be O(1) time if they still need to run the aggregate over every element.

I also don't see any reference to quantifier elimination, so I wonder if that's part of previous work and their approach is powerful because it applicable with or without quantifier elimination. I feel like some discussion around the queries that cannot have quantifiers eliminated and how well their approach works for these queries should be established in this paper.

I am also not sure how I feel about the yield points. They don't seem to help readability any more than functions, and I am actually not sure on the semantics of what happens between yield points, if anything. It seems something that's actually less human readable than an approach such as registering handlers.

I also think I understand what a witness is in this context, but I'm not sure what a set of witnesses refers to.

I like that the running example has examples in the language proposed by this paper, and in the incrementalized version compared to an English version.

## Research Question and What to Investigate
I would like to investigate why in the world they used python 2.5 for their incrementalizer and python 3.0 for their compiler. Investigation of this would be easily done by messaging the authors. But I am also unsure why there only seems to be one reference in the paper to their incrementalizer, InvTS. It seems clearly built in-house, but there is no reference to another paper, nor is there any discussion on implementation.
