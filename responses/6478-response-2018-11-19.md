# CMPS 290S Reading Response: From Clarity to Efficiency for Distributed Algorithms

## Summary
This paper proposes a programming language for distributed systems with simplified syntax that is easy for people to understand. The primary technical contribution of this language is the transformation of existential and universal quantifiers to incremental, monotonic computations. The described language is pythonic in syntax and very easy to read.

## Learning and Understanding
The use of incremental computation seems clearly space efficient because it minimizes the amount of state that must be maintained, but I am not sure how it is computationally any more efficient? The paper claims:

    In particular, each resulting aggregate query result can be obtained in O(1) time
    and incrementally maintained in O(1) time per update to the sets maintained and
    affected plus the time for evaluating the conditions in the aggregate query once
    per update
  
But I'm not sure how they can consider it to be O(1) time if they still need to run the aggregate over every element.

I also don't see any reference to quantifier elimination, so I wonder if that's part of previous work and their approach is powerful because it applicable with or without quantifier elimination. I feel like some discussion around the queries that cannot have quantifiers eliminated and how well their approach works for these queries should be established in this paper.
