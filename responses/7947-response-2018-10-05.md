# Response to "Linearizabiliy: A Correctness Condition for Concurrent Objects"

#### Authors: Maurice P. Herlihy and Jeannette M. Wing

## Summary

The paper was a bit long and I was not able to read it thoroughly. From what I read, I understood that the authors tried to formalize the concept of Linearizability. There were some parts of the paper I didn't really understand. The main idea was to convert concurrent operations into serial operations in order to reason about them properly. The Queue data structure plays an important part in the paper. Linearizability is defined in terms of concurrent operations processed in a queue.

At times I was a bit confused about the terminology: why not call it "serializability"? I refered some outside blogs (http://www.bailis.org/blog/linearizability-versus-serializability/) which gave a good idea of the differences between linearizability and serializability. To my surprise the contents of the blog were based on this paper and I was able to follow the paper better after having read the blog.


## Questions

I had some questions on why certain operations were labeled "not acceptable" in figures 1 and 2 but once the idea that all of these operations were inside a queue was established, my understanding of the idea operations became much clearer. However, I still need to read and understand proofs in the paper, especially those in the appendix. 


## Ideas

On a casual reading of the paper, I had a question regarding how atomicity of operations is guaranteed in linearizable concurrent operations.

## Developing the ideas

I need to read the paper and references to papers discussing atomicity to be able to answer this question.
