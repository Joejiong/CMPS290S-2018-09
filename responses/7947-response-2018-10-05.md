# Response to "Linearizabiliy: A Correctness Condition for Concurrent Objects"

#### Authors: Maurice P. Herlihy and Jeannette M. Wing

## Summary

The paper was a bit long and I was not able to read it thoroughly. From what I read, I understood that the authors tried to formalize the concept of Linearizability. There were some parts of the paper I didn't really understand. The main idea was to convert concurrent operations into serial operations in order to reason about them properly. At times I was a bit confused about the terminology: why not call it "serializability"? I refered some outside blogs (http://www.bailis.org/blog/linearizability-versus-serializability/) which gave a good idea of the differences between linearizability and serializability. The Queue data structure plays an important part in the paper. Linearizability is defined in terms of operations processed in a queue.  

## Questions

I had some questions on why certain operations were labeled "not acceptable" in figures 1 and 2 but once the idea that all of these operations were inside a queue was established, my understanding of the idea operations became much clearer. However, I still need to read and understand proofs in the paper, especially those in the appendix.
