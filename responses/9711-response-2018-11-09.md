This paper presents a declarative programming model for use with eventually consistent data stores. This is a response to the authors claims of lacking programming abstractions surrounding replicated data types  (I can attest to that being a problem) along with difficulties in assigning consistency levels to different operations. The model, called QUELEA, includes a contract language and a contract enforcement system that will generate the correct consistency protocol for a given method. Just a comment, after a while the introductions to all of these papers we are reading start to blur together and sound the same. In the end the gist of the authors argument is that there arenâ€™t enough abstractions. The contract language is used to specify a set of legal executions allowed on a replicated data type (I really want to say CRDT here just by reflex). In order to build these contracts they use primitive consistency relations that are linked by basic relational and logical operations. Session order is one of these primitive relations and is defined as the order of effects within the same session. The full set of relations utilized are visibility, session order, same object, and operation (associating effect with an operation). The authors use the model of a bank account replicated data type (why on earth would you use eventual consistency for this?). As I would expect from a PL paper (I know it is not always the case) the implementation is an extension of an existing functional language. Consistency and convergence between replicas are considered separately. Which allows them to reason about the data types with in both operational and declarative manners. After describing their basic account program they consider the anomalies of unsafe withdraw, negative balance, and a missing update under a simple eventually consistent data store. From here the authors present their contract language. Which contains a series of definitions, semantics, and syntax rules. For the purposes of the paper they present sematnics for only eventual, causal, and strong consistency. The authors also apply their contract language to the session guarantees consistency lattice provided in the Terry paper from earlier in the quarter in order to demonstrate the generality of their language. After all of this they finally show a more sensible approach to a bank account, transactions. Specifically coordination-free transactions. To do this the authors provide some extensions to the semantics and present new code for transactions. This new code provides both classification of transaction isolation levels and atomic operations. The implementation of QUELEA (how in the world do I pronounce this?) is done in Haskell and implemented atop Cassandra (because no one wants to modify cassandra). The proof obligations are handled by an SMT solver. I am somewhat bitter that the paper did not provide more specific results concerning QUELEAs performance compared to pure cassandra.

What I learned from this paper is that there are declarative programming language approaches to the problem of making eventual consistency easier. Due to my unfamiliarity with declarative programming it will take me some time for me to pick through the semantics and fully understand what is going on. I especially got a bit lost with the section on transactions. I am wondering if being within 30% latency and 20% throughput of Cassandra is an acceptable overhead. To me it seems a bit high where the trade off is easy implementation.
