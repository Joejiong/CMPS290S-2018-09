# Response to "Rehearsal: A Configuration Verification Tool for Puppet"

#### Authors: Shambaugh et al.

## Summary

The paper deals with configuration verification problem in Puppet. The flexibility in the design of Puppet configurations allows errors to be inadvertently added to them. The errors arise mainly due to non-determinism and non-idempotence of the configurations in Puppet.

## Things I liked
 
The characterization of failures in Puppet configurations was explained very well.

## Comments

The problems described in the "Silent Failure"  in 2.2 describes what can happen in systems where the user (configuration writer) is not familiar with system dependencies. The proposed solution is to build a resource graph and evaluate dependency relations. This makes me a bit uneasy. Does this paper just explain bugs in the Puppet system and how those bugs can be solved? The use of apt-file/repoquery is necessary as the configuration writers may not be aware of the dependency relations between software packages. It would be interesting to find out if the problems listed in Puppet still exist in the latest version. The paper presents useful techniques for dependency management in Puppet and much of what was discussed could directly be incorporated into Puppet to make the puppet runtime verifications better. In my previous company a huge amount of work was put into verifying software dependencies whenever a new software was to be installed (in an enterprise software configuration management tool) and this paper provides interesting insights into how that verification process could be automated.

I was wondering if a configuration management could design to be a deterministic system ensuring that there are no non-deterministic elements that could be added by the users without sacrificing flexibility in writing configuration files. I'm not sure if it can be done or how to go about it. I think it is an interesting area of research.
