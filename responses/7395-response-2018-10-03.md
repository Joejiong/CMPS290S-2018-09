## Response: 'CAP Twelve years later'

### Summary

The CAP theorem asserts that only two of three desirable properties are achievable in network shared systems. But in the world of wide area networks, one cannot ignore partition-tolerance. So, by explicitly handling partitions, designers can optimize consistency and availability, thereby achieving some trade-off of all three. The ACID properties focus on consistency which is the traditional database approach. BASE, which is completely opposite to ACID, focuses on availability and is being used for emerging design approaches. The paper mentions that CAP theorem ignores latency although latency and partition are deeply related. Partition is a time bound on communication. Failing to achieve consistency within the time-bound implies a partition and thus a choice between consistency and availability is to be done.

The authors discuss an approach to mitigate partition related issues which involves three steps:
1. Detect the start of a partition.
2. Enter an explicit partition mode that may limit some operations.
3. Initiate partition recovery when communication is restored.

When the system enters partition mode after the timeout, there are two strategies:

1. To limit some operations, thereby reducing availability, and
2. To record extra information about operations that will be helpful during partition recovery.

One way to track the sequence of operations is to maintain a history of operations which captures casual dependency between them. During partition, some operations are delayed and some invariants are violated. The designer must solve two hard problems during recovery:

1. state on both sides must become consistent, and
2. there must be compensation for the mistakes made during partition mode.

The paper mentions commutative replicated data types (CRDTs), which provably converge after a partition.
### What’s one thing I learned?
BASE and CRDTs are new concepts that I learned. 

### What’s something I didn’t understand?
I understood the paper and there is nothing specific that is not clear to me.

### What’s a research-level question I have after having read this paper?
1.  How modern distributed systems are managing partitions and what all partition recovery methods they are using?
### What’s a concrete step I can take toward answering the research question?
1. Enquiring further into the working of current distributed systems.
