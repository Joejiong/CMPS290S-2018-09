## Response: 'Replicated Data Types: Specification, Verification, Optimality'

### Summary

The paper introduces eventual consistency as a buzzword and that modern distributed databases fake that they provide eventual consistency, as there is no proper low-level semantics to define the anomalies and conflicts that database exhibits. The paper claims that it formulates replicated data type specifications for conflict resolution and consistency axioms for anomalies, verifies the correctness of replicated data type implementations and explains methods to prove lower bounds on metadata space requirements.

Replicated data type specifications determine return values of operations in terms of visibility and arbitration relations and thus define conflict resolution policies like last-write-wins,  add-wins, etc. Consistency axioms constrain visibility and arbitration and thus disallow anomalies.

Four data type specifications are discussed, namely:
1. Counter where operations commute so no conflicts
2. Last-Win-Writes
3. Multi-value register where all conflicting values are returned
4. Observed remove set where conflicts are resolved in an application-specific way, like in shopping cart example, where add operation wins against concurrent remove operation.

The correctness of data type implementations is proved via replication-aware simulation relations where the behavior of a single state of replica and state-based message are considered separately. Then optimality is discussed where methods to reduce metadata overhead are mentioned.

### What’s one thing I learned?
Calling eventual consistency a buzzword is actually true because there are no fixed set of rules which define it. The best thing about paper is that it discusses replicated data types in-depth from semantics perspective and provides well defined specifications for conflict resolution and correctness. Previous papers just mentioned about the overhead of maintaning extra information about replicated data types but this paper makes a genuine effort to provide techniques to handle this problem.

### What I did not understand in the paper?
Data type specifications and verification steps of the paper related to operation-based and state-based data types is clear to me. Optimization of metadata is the part I did not understand well. (The video of this paper did not explain this portion)

### What’s a research-level question I have after having read this paper?
As this paper sets specifications and verifications for replicated data types, which systems actually used these semantics to implement replicated data stores.

### What’s a concrete step I can take toward answering the research question?
My concrete step will be to look at implementation of the systems which used the semantics formulated in this paper.
