# Causal memory: definitions, implementation, and programming 

Mustaque Ahamad, Gil Neiger, James E. Burns, Prince Kohli, Phillip W. Hutto 

## Summary

The authors present the formalization of Causal consistency, something they
present as midway between sequential consistency and PRAM (pipelined RAM)
models. The pipelined RAM model ensures that all processes perform all
writes in the system, while reads are locally done by the process. In 
effect, it is similar to PRAM, but with additional restrictions to maintain
cause - effect order.

Non unique writes to the data objects can cause issues here, since cause 
and effect can be hard to determine. They introduce causality order as :
"partial order that is the transitive closure of the union of history's
program order and the order of writes"

This could have been better phrases as it is a pretty hard to parse 
sentence. Causal memory is defined as a serialization S' that respects the
causality order.

The implementation uses vector clocks [1] to implement causal order. Each 
process maintains a private copy of data, a vector clock, an InQueue and 
an OutQueue. The Inqueue and the outqueue items maintain vector timestamps.
The information from OutQueue is communicated to other processes through
message passing. The messages received are added to the InQueue. This 
is then used by each process to update their view of the memory.  
 
## Interesting Points

While this can allow us to implement non-blocking programs, the overhead of
maintaining vector clocks, historical values, and the queues of all writes
seens to be really high. 

Theorem 4 is really interesting, if you can prevent concurrent writes, you
can maintain sequential consistency with the same model. Same with preventing data races.

## Research level question

Causality is somewhat hard to reason about, unless you place restrictions
on what you are allowed to do. If something _not happening_ causes an event
to happen, what is the cause in this case? How do you reason about that?

Say, your server went down and not getting a response, fired up the
recovery mechanism. Is the cause here something that didn't happen? 
Similarly, it seems to me that it is really hard to determine what causes
events to happen in a moderate scale system. 

## Closing thoughts

The paper presents very interesting results as well as presenting PRAM
and sequential models. However, while the paper talks about PRAM to some 
extent, it doesn't really go in-depth about sequential model. 

The paper explains the implementation in depth, however, there are no
results or any kind of evaluation of the implementation. It seems to me
that this would have a high time and space overhead, however, there
is no discussion about that.

Finally, I think the language and symbols used in the paper are somewhat
hard to parse, and I had to reread sentences 4-5 times to get an idea of 
what the sentence was actually saying. This and the formal definitions
make this paper hard to read.
