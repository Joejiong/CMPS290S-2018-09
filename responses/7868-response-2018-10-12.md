They say “principle advantages” on the first page. Who do we contact if we find a typo in
the IEEE? :p

This is then a paper on… they list it as four independent guarantees, but am I right in
believing that this combination is what we mean by “read-your-writes consistency” today?
Translating their guarantees into the specifications of a partial order that must be
preserved (per process/session) gives us:

* if `w1` happens before `r1`, then `w1 < r1`
* if `r1` happens before `r2` and `w1 < r1`, then `w1 < r2` (I think?)
* if `r1` happens before `w1`, then `r1 < w1`
* if `w1` happens before `w2`, then `w1 < w2`

(smallest transitive closure such that yadda yadda)

The wrinkle is that property two is actually somewhat looser: `w1 < r1` only applies if
`w1` is “relevant” to `r1`, but I'm not sure how we intend the system to decide that in
practice.

I'm abusing notation slightly here in that I'm taking the causal-consistency viewpoint
that the partial order represents _pretty much_ logical causality in property two but not
in the other properties. I can't tell if that _matters_—does it matter for, say, property
one, if `W` is in `DB(S,t)` or `RelevantWrites(S,t,R)`? I don't think so?

(The paper does note towards the end that in practice, nodes will probably treat the full
set of writes as the set of relevant writes.)

Eliding that distinction, this simplifies to: reads can be concurrent upto write barriers,
but every other pair of operations has a strict total order. That is, we no longer have
Lamport's processes; they're no longer strictly identified with a total order of
operations, but allow precisely this much more concurrency in their reads.

(“Anti-entropy” is an excellent name for an “eventually _” property.)

The rest of the paper is on implementation concerns, which at the least involves ensuring
servers can maintain lists of operations that are `<` any particular client's
operations. Or, we can maintain vector clocks to just track the partial order, as before,
and that also just works. You have to maintain two local vectors, a writes-only version
and a full version (this is an optimisation over considering each read its own
Lamport-process, I believe), but I don't think there's any other oddities.

Ultimately, I found this paper somewhat obtuse, but that's not its fault. The language
it's using is probably from before we developed the partial-order language for describing
concurrent operations/distributed systems, and—assuming my translation is accurate—I think
that's a clear example of how much more understandable the newer language is.

The new language also helps me situate this paper in the consistency hierarchy—yep, okay,
we loosen the conditions on the partial order within a process, got it. If we end up being
able to describe the full consistency hierarchy this way by the end of the class, I'll be
happy :)
