# CAP Twelve Years Later: How the "Rules" Have Changed
 
## Summary

Eric Brewer weighs in on the CAP theorem, 12 years after it was formalized
in 2000. 

As we saw in the Brewer's Conjecture paper :
CAP states that it is impossible to achieve

- Consistency : Atomic or linearizable consistency : 
the changes will be indistinguishable from the same steps executed on a 
single threaded execution.

- Availability : Every request must terminate in a bounded time.

- Partition Tolerance : Every node must respond to requests, even if messages 
are lost in case of a network partition.

at the same time in web services. If you relax one of the conditions, 
it is possible to guarantee the other two. 

Brewer states that the "2 out of 3" formulation is a rather simplistic view
of system design, and the trade-off is always between availability and 
consistency.

The article brings in the database terminologies : ACID and BASE in addition
to CAP to discuss this. I am glad the authors themselves agree what a bad 
acronym BASE is. The author contrasts ACID and CAP, and how Consistency in
a database is much stricter than CAP, a common misunderstanding due to the
loose definition of Consistency.

Brewer also responds to the critique [1] that latency is an important design
decision that was not addressed by CAP. It boils down to making a decision :
do you pick consistency and risk availability and latency, or do you go ahead
and respond to the request sacrificing consistency? 
 
## Interesting Points

Unlike the CAP theorem paper, this paper goes in depth about how to address 
partitions while designing a system. The author suggests going into a limited
state on detecting partitions (read-only?) and recover only when contact is 
reestablished.

The idea of using version vectors (vector clocks) allows us to maintain causal
consistency. 

Another fascinating approach is the use of real-world examples for compensation
(airlines) and limits (ATMs) which Brewer uses. I think this is an important 
distinction vis รก vis academic papers, which rarely use in real world analogies.

## Research level question

The idea of going into a limited state depending on invariants on partition is 
very interesting. Are there any other strategies based around limited 
availability? We have seen weaker consistency models, are there weaker
availability models?


## Closing thoughts

This paper nicely summarizes the discussion we had in the last class and sets up
the tone for the rest of the class. It briefly touches upon a lot of advancements
and techniques that came after it, including consensus protocols, CRDTs, 
commutative and monotonically increasing operations to resolve conflicts, version
control systems. We will discuss some of these topics over the course.

As a feedback for the class, it doesn't seem to me like this article requires a
dedicated class to it, especially because we reached a lot of conclusions of this
paper in the last class itself. Maybe it can be assigned together in the next
instance?
