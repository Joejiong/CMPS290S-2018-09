# Response to "From Clarity to Efficiency for Distributed Algorithms"

#### Authors: Liu et al.

## Summary

The aim of the authors is to create a simplified language to express distributed algorithms. In the paper the authors implement DistAlgo on top of python runtime. The language syntax is similar to python. The authors essentially implement an event processing system which has a more compact means of representing program behaviour.

## Things I liked

1. The abstractions created to write distributed programs. This I felt are the main contributions of the paper.

## Questions

1. What does "efficiency" really mean for a programming language? From the paper it seems that the authors have made program size as the main metric. They show in the final figure (Figure 8) that DistAlgo has the longest runtime. So why use DistAlgo? If it were implemented as a compiled language it may be faster. The expressivity of DistAlgo is probably the best thing about DistAlgo. This should have been compared to similarly expressive distributed system programming languages such as Erlang.

## Comments

1. Can all distributed algorithms be represented by an event processing system via send and receive primitives?
2. The "lines of code" metric is not the best metric to specify the efficiency of an algorithm. It is especially not useful when comparing programs in different languages.
3. Even compile time is not a good metric. Just because compile time takes long does not mean runtime efficiency is bad.
4. The title is misleading: DistAlgo is not efficient at runtime as seen from Figure 8 (at least not for Lamport's algorithm).

## Ideas
1. It would be interesting to see if abstractions that are implemented in DistAlgo could also be implemented via libraries in other languages which are faster than DistAlgo.
