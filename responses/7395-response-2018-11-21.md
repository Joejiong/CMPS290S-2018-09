## Response: 'PSYNC: A Partially Synchronous Language for Fault-Tolerant Distributed Algorithms'

### Summary

<p align="justify">
Summary
The paper introduces PSYNC which is a domain specific language based on Heard-Of model. The authors mention the concept of indistinguishability where the client using PSYNC won’t be able to distinguish between asynchronous faulty systems and synchronous systems with explicit message dropping and delays to introduce faults. The paper mentions that via HO-sets explicit faults can be injected in the system. They use PSYNC to implement LastVoting algorithm of Paxos protocol and make comparisons with other implementations in terms of code-size and performance.

### Learning
<p align="justify">
I did not really understand what is special about indistinguishability. Also, is it really beneficial to divide an algorithm into specific rounds of execution.

### What’s a research-level question I have after having read this paper?
<p align="justify">
Is PSYNC being used for any current distributed systems?
