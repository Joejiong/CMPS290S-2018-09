## Summary

Both papers try to address the issue of rolling upgrades while the system is
still functioning. As discussed in [1] there are several challenges in updating
a distributed system. Updates need to be simple, they should be able to strip off
functionality, making versions incompatible. Persistent data should be compatible
with the new version, or at least, be transformable into the new format. Upgrades
and updates should be automatic in case of large system installations. The
system should allow specification of this upgradability and it should be
performed with no down time.

The last point is of particular interest to me, the authors seem very permissive
in their approach at the cost of complexity. If versions are API incompatible
and you want to keep the system running, a combination of old and new could end
up with unintended byzantine faults. Transformation of database types can be
expensive.

[2] takes a more network oriented approach of solving problems, using software
defined networking (SDN) and lower level protocols to allow network upgrades
and changes. They introduce the notion of per-packet consistency (which to me
seems more like a guarantee almost like atomicity) and per-flow consistency,
guaranteeing that network changes mean either only the old or the new status
is reflected in packets, with no mixing. This means when a network upgrade rolls
out, the packet will have either the before state or the after state.

They introduce mechanisms to deal with this situation. The first rule is that no
packet (after the first) can follow the path old -> new. Two phase upgrade mechanism
upgrades the port numbers internally, but only applies the upgrade when accepting
packets with the new configuration.

## Interesting Points

[1] was an interesting read, however, it seems to me that in a controlled
environment like a single data center, they could make some of the requirements
stronger to simplify the system to a large extent. The incompatibility mixed with
rolling upgrades which serve the system is not something you would want to deal with.

[2] Software defined networking is super cool, and I wonder why we don't see more
applications of it for distributed systems. I worked a bit on something similar
during my internship, and the amount of power and flexibility it gives you is
extremely helpful in many situations.


## Research level question

[1] Could you perhaps do a major-minor upgrade system that behaves differently
depending on the impact of the upgrade? Minor upgrades which don't change how the
system fundamentally behaves can be rolled out easily, while major upgrades that
could break compatibility can use this system.

[2] I wonder if smart network switches and computation could be used to run
multiple instances of port and network config state, until all the old packets
are consumed.
