# Response to "Causal memory: definitions, implementation, and programming"

#### Authors: Ahamad et al.

## Summary

The paper describes "causal memory" as a weak consistency model. The main aim of this model is to be a practical and efficient compared to strong consistency models such as linearization. A weak consistency model allows more operations to be performed without having to deal with maintaining a strict order of execution at all times, thus allowing "more concurrency".

To define causal memory, the authors first describe sequential consistency and pipelined RAM (PRAM). Where a set of executions are sequentially consistent when serialization of histories must respect _all_ program orders, they are in PRAM if they satisfy serialization on local histories. Causal memory is stronger than PRAM but weaker than sequential consistency in that it incorporates conditions for PRAM but in addition to that the executions must also be causal.

The definition of causal memory was both interesting and intuitive. 

## Questions

1. Does the concept of causal memory also apply to non-von neumann programming languages (the functional programming class). From what I've heard the problem of race conditions should not occur in models where data is immutable.

2. How does this consistency model relate with the current harware and programming languages in use? Where in the heirarchy of a computer are these models implemented? One possible answer I had was the main memory (RAM) but I wanted to get some clarification on this.

3. Can consistency models be built within programming language description or does the runtime environment need to take care of implementing it?

One hint for my question on whether programming language runtime environments provide a consistency model was from [1] (the consistency model is part of the memory model implemented for the jvm).

## Ideas

I found the idea of proving that a class of programs can be executed correctly on causal memory. In their analysis the authors assumed (and also in the other papers) a single processor executing the program. The idea was that there might be multiple hosts that might be reading and writing concurrently. I wanted to check how this pattern (and the other patters we have studied so far) work in a multi-core, multi-threaded systems.

## Developing the ideas

I found a few papers on consistency models for multi-threaded systems when I checked Google Scholar as well as some on verifying memory consistency. I will check for other papers that are able to answer my other questions as well.
