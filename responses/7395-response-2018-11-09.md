## Response: 'Declarative Programming over Eventually Consistent Data Stores'

### Summary

<p align="justify">
The paper introduces Quelea which is a declarative programming model for eventually consistent data stores. The key feature of Quelea is the contract language which the programmers used to specify application-level consistency properties. These contracts are constructed using visibility and session order relations. The interesting thing about the paper is that the convergence property of replicated data types is considered separate from their consistency guarantees. This allows two separate threads of reasoning: operation reasoning for conflict resolution and declarative reasoning for consistency. I liked how authors used the term ‘observable equivalence’ for summarization of histories of RDTs.

Compared to the MixT paper, where they were implementing the operations or methods based on the consistency level of the underlying data store, where they specify application-level consistency contracts and then try to map them to store-level consistency guarantees.  Until now, I found this paper which tries to explain both single object level consistency constraints and transaction-level constraints.

The best thing about the paper is that they implemented their framework over NoSQL key-values stores which kind of prove their applicability to current distributed settings.

### What’s one thing I learned?
<p align="justify">
My take away from this paper is the separation of operational and declarative reasoning and how contract language is used to specify both single-object-level and transaction-level consistency constraints.
</p>

### What I did not understand?
<p align="justify">
I did not understand transaction contracts clearly. So, I want that to be discussed further.
</p>

### What’s a research-level question I have after having read this paper?

<p align="justify">
Since in the paper they have mentioned about their implementation over key-value stores, so my question is that:
</p>

1.  Is Quelea currently being used by these data-stores? 
2.  If yes, is it able to achieve the required consistency contraints?

### What’s a concrete step I can take toward answering the research question?

<p align="justify">
My concrete step will be to the read papers which used Quelea to ensure varied level of consistency guarantees and how these systems are performing.
