## Response: ’Cause I’m Strong Enough:Reasoning about Consistency Choices in Distributed Systems

### Summary

One of the hard problem is to figure out the minimum consistency level sufficient to maintain correctness. The main contribution of the paper are proof rules and tools for checking integrity invariants under given consistency choices.

The authors introduce the concept of RedBlue Consistency which is hybrid consistency model comprising of red operations that are guaranteed sequential consistency and blue operations that are guaranteed causal consistency. Red operations are totally ordered by happens-before relation and blue operations are only partially ordered. The key feature of this paper is their claim that ‘Hybrid Model guarantees at least Causal Consistency’. Until now, all of the previous PL papers have just claimed to achieve eventual consistency. In order to enforce causality, the authors introduce token system, where operations acquire tokens to ensure happens-before relation.

### What’s one thing I learned?
I like the new term coined in the paper 'RedBlue' consistency. Using a token system to guarantee causal consistency is the main crux of the paper.  Since there is no concrete implementation of the same, so not sure how it will behave in real-time implementation. 

### What’s a research-level question I have after having read this paper?
The authors mention that there are no implementations of this framework but can encode many existing models. So my research question will be:
1. Are there any current systems are using this model?
2. If yes, what kind of latencies or complexities token system can generate?

### What’s a concrete step I can take toward answering the research question?
My concrete step will be to the read papers which used this model and implemented the same for real-time distributed systems.
