# CMPS 290S Reading Response: P: safe asynchronous event-driven programming

## Summary
This paper describes a DSL called "P", that tries to provide a _unified_ programming model for modeling and programming of a system. A system can be modeled using a state machine with asynchronous events, and an environment can be modeled as a set of logical state machines, called _ghost machines_. A ghost machine provides a search space for testing the P program via model checking, and is not used in the runtime of P.

## Learning and Understanding
My impression of the motivation for ghost machines is to provide a model (specification) of how "foreign objects" are allowed to interact with the system being programmed. The idea of an environment, then, would be a logical set of foreign objects that interact with the system directly. In the elevator example, ghost machines are: users, the elevator door, and an elevator timer. It seems that this explicitly defines these 3 machines (objects) as the only entities that an elevator system needs to interact with, and so it provides a clear mental model for the developer to think about the system (or makes clear how the developer is programming the system) while the P language is then able to use these machines to test the definition of the elevator system and explore states and state transitions. I'm not sure if there is another reason for the ability to specify the environment, and I'm not sure if there is what types of bugs verification of the environment does not prevent.

I definitely do not understand Figure 7, and what the number of states represent. There is no explanation of ElevatorX100 for me to use to figure it out either.

## Research Question and What to Investigate
Thinking about the specification of the environment, I wonder if there is some analysis that can be done to determine parts of the system being programmed that are not verified by the ghost machines. That is, my impression of verification by ghost machine is that the states of the ghost machines are used to verify states and transitions of the system, but if we omit part, or all of the timer ghost machine, does the verifier know that part of the elevator system is not explored, or does it just verify that the states explored do not violate liveness and correctness (transitions are correct).
