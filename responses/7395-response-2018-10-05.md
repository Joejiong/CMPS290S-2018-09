## Response: 'Linearizability: A Correctness Condition for Concurrent Objects'

### Summary

The paper introduces linearizability as a consistency model. It states that linearizability is a guarantee about single operations on single objects. Under linearizability, each operation applied by concurrent processes takes effect instantaneously at some point between its invocation and its response. The paper explains the difference between serializability and linearizability. While linearizability is a local, non-blocking property which focuses on a single object, serializability is a global, blocking property which focuses on all the objects involved in concurrent system.

A history is a sequence of invocations and responses made of an object by a set of processes. An invocation can be thought of as the start of an operation, and the response being the end of that operation. Each invocation of a function will have a subsequent response. The paper states that sequential consistency is weaker than linearizability, because it does not require the history’s precedence ordering to be preserved. Serializability is the basic correctness condition for concurrent computations in a database. In databases, concurrency is thought in terms of transactions that applies a sequence of operations to a set of objects shared with other transactions. In linearizability transactions are restricted to consist of a single operation applied to a single object.

The interesting part of the paper's is the comparison between linearizability and serializability.

### What’s one thing I learned?
The concept of linearizability was new to me, so that is one thing I learned. 

### What’s something I didn’t understand?
It would be great if we can discuss some examples which clearly differentiates between serializability and linearizability and posses that linearlizability is more stringent.

### What’s a research-level question I have after having read this paper?
The paper gives examples of histories under perfect scenarios where there is no latency, no messages are lost in partitions and there is perfect communication between partitions. How do such histories work in real-time settings? How are they made linearizable in such situations? 
### What’s a concrete step I can take toward answering the research question?
Enquiring further into the real-time setting of concurrent systems and how linearizability works in such environments.
