# Summary
The paper describes the CAP theorem in formal words. CAP (and BASE?) was
initially described by Eric Brewer during a Keynote at PODC (principles of
distributed computing). The CAP theorem states that a distributed system
cannot have 100% of 3 properties:

# *C*onsistency
# *A*vailability
# Tolerance to Network *P*artitions

Gilbert and Lynch decided to formalize and prove the conjecture using an
asynchronous network model, and then explore the implications of the theory and
related proofs using a partially synchonous model.

# Learned
This is the first paper I read which uses the formal asynchronous network model
to prove properties of distributed algorithms. It also gives me a sense of how
powerful clocks make understanding a distributed system, since it allows a
partially synchronous network model to be used.
