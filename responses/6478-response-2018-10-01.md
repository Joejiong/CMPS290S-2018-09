# Summary
The paper describes the CAP theorem in formal words. CAP (and BASE?) was
initially described by Eric Brewer during a Keynote at PODC (principles of
distributed computing). The CAP theorem states that a distributed system
cannot have 100% of 3 properties:

1. *C*onsistency
2. *A*vailability
3. Tolerance to Network *P*artitions

Gilbert and Lynch decided to formalize and prove the conjecture using an
asynchronous network model, and then explore the implications of the theory and
related proofs using a partially synchonous model.

# Learning and Understanding
This is the first paper I read which uses the formal asynchronous network model
to prove properties of distributed algorithms. It also gives me a sense of how
powerful clocks make understanding a distributed system, since it allows a
partially synchronous network model to be used.

I feel like network partitions are always defined in such a way that a graph of
connected components: G, is split into two subgraphs: G' and G'', and a
client: C. Where C is capable of sending messages to G' and G'', but for some
reason G' and G'' are unable to find each other. It seems more general and
correct to assume that C is on a side of the partition, and thus able to
communicate only with components in G' or G'', but not both.

# Research Question and What to Investigate
I am interested in further properties of partially synchronous network models,
and why partially synchronous is a property that allows the benefits of a fully
asynchronous network but with slightly stronger guarantees that come with a
fully synchronous network. It makes me wonder if there is much work on
implementing such clocks at the network level and pushing analysis of
consistency and availability down the technical stack, but making that
information available for higher level applications to use.

Consistency tends to be something typically analyzed at a particular level of
the stack, typically by an application that is implementing the consistency
protocol. It would be useful to find research that divides the mechanism and
policy of a consistency protocol into multiple levels of abstraction. Further
research that may be relevant to find would be something that allows mechanisms
or policies of various protocols to be dynamically included.
