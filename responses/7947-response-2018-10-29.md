# Paper: "Replicated Data Types: Specification, Verification, Optimality"

#### Authors: Burckhardt et al.

## Summary:

The authors goal in this paper is to formalize (once and for all) the theory of data replication across a distributed network. As the title suggests, the authors provide a specification framework for replicated data types and adding conflict resolution strategies within the scope of the data type specification. This allows total order (or the means of achieving total order) to be declared within type specification. 

The specification uses relationships between operations to establish the current state of the system. I feel that this is a good approach as it allows state to be computed rather than stored in case of crashes (Something similar is also used in RDD transformations in Spark. Data remains immutable where as a set of transformations allows datasets to be computed and stored in memory and in case of a crash RDD can be recomputed by applying lineage transformations. However, RDDs are not a data type specification). State based replicated data types are also compared with operation based types where operation based win out based on space optimality (state based approach required state changes to be stored). 

The verification of the specification is done by building _replication aware simulations_. The goal is to create a verification system where global correctness of data types can be established by reasoning about operation on local operations or state changes. Optimality considerations boiled down to optimizing for space constraints.  

## Questions and doubts:

## Research Ideas:

Optimizing based on metadata maintanence provides a good means of judging a type system as data has to be stored on local machines. However, since systems these days tend to have a large amount of memory and data rates have also increased exponentially, runtime optimization of computing global correctness could also be an interesting direction of research. That would probably require reasoning about implementation details. There are implementations of CRDTs available on quite a few programming languages. It would be interesting to have an implementation available for the replicated data type specification framework described in this paper.
