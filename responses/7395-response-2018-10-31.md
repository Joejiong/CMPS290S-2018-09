## Response: 'Disciplined Inconsistency with Consistency Types'

### Summary

The paper attempts to provide concrete implementations to the opaque concept of relaxed consistency. The authors propose a programming model for IPA (Inconsistent, Performance-bound, Approximate) storage system that makes programmers specify performance targets and consistency requirements as constraints on data structures and handle uncertainty using consistency types. The interesting property of IPA is consistency safety which guarantees that values from weakly consistent operations cannot flow into stronger consistency operations without programmer’s consent (forcing the programmer to take hold of this).

I think the definitions of consistency types and error-bound consistency are kind of very loose and there is nothing new about it. Systems like Cassandra already provide tunable consistency ranging from eventual to strong, so return value from the operation can be any value ranging between these models. The only fact is that Cassandra or other NoSQL data stores do not explicitly claim that return value can be in a stipulated range depending upon the consistency models specified by the programmer and can tolerate this amount of numeric error. As I always said, programming languages papers are interesting to read because they emphasize implementation.

### What’s one thing I learned?
This paper is kind of on similar grounds with the previous paper but more inclined towards implementation, which is always good. Consistency safety is an interesting property that I learned.

### What I did not understand in the paper?
I did not understand what are rusted types and how they are being implemented?

### What’s a research-level question I have after having read this paper?
The paper mentions that they created a framework over Cassandra and tested the same. Have the authors tried using this model over other data-stores? What other data types they have defined using this framework.

### What’s a concrete step I can take toward answering the research question?
My concrete step will be to the read papers which used this model and implemented the same for other applications.
