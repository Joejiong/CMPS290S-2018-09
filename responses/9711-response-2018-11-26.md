This paper describes another domain specific programming language called P which is used to describe a set of state machines. This allows the program to both model and write the program at the same time. Like previous DSL’s we have covered this one allows not only compilation to an executable but also some form of checking on the code beyond normal compiler syntax/type checking. There is a concept of a “ghost machine” that serves a purpose in checking the program that is thrown out when the code is compiled. The language possesses the “deferred events” that are used to strike a balance between synchronous and asynchronous events so that there is some bound on how long an operation can be delayed for. Therefore avoiding issues of state explosion if the language was to allow for events to be delayed arbitrarily long. Program checking is performed by a method called systematic testing in which the operational semantics are examined using a state model checker. A  method called delay bounded scheduling is used to avoid the issues that arise when using  depth bounded searches to explore the non deterministic system. The paper gives nice program examples as flowcharts that are relatively easy to understand. Although the syntax and especially the event handling semantics are dense enough that it will take me a while to parse through them. The implementation section is decently well written yet while it reports statistics for the state exploration, which found a good deal of bugs, there isn’t any in depth comparison of the old USB driver and the new beyond simply mentioning that there is a 30% difference in speed.

I am incredibly impressed by this paper as the implementation is of a driver stack. This makes my inner systems developer happy and is a welcome departure from shopping carts. What I learned from this paper is that a model-based (correct term? I am not sure what to call P) DSLs can be used to implement device drivers in an actual OS. It might be that I am reading this while rather tired but I am a bit iffy on delay bounded scheduling and don’t understand that fully yet. My research question is how easily could this language be used to perform other event driven I/O operations? Would it work well outside of a windows environment? Maybe Linux? A concrete step towards this would be to implement another driver in P.  Maybe something networking focused? The robotics blurb on their github page is interesting.
