## Response: 'A comprehensive study of Convergent and Commutative Replicated Data Types'

### Summary

The paper talks about CRDTs in detail and presents various CRDT designs like registers, counters, sets, graphs, etc. In comparison to the previous paper, I found the language of this paper to be confusing. Also, the paper tries to pose CRDT as an ideal data type for replicated environments since it requires ‘no synchronization’.

The paper clearly differentiates state-based and operation-based CRDTs. In state-based replication, the update is processed entirely at source replica and then the payload is transmitted to other replicas. Whereas, in operation-based replication, operations are transmitted. The paper then defines eventual consistency and how CRDTs can guarantee the same. Various CRDTs designs are discussed to show their usefulness.

The paper then talks about various counter implementations like State-based PN counter which can be used to track the number of users logged in to Skype, Last-Write-Wins and MV Registers and sets based data structures like maps and graphs.

The interesting part is that authors give real-time application examples like e-commerce websites, Amazon carts and shared text editors which makes me curious to explore few of these further.

### What’s one thing I learned?
This paper tries to clearly differentiate between state-based and operation-based CRDTs. As I mentioned, the only interesting thing about the paper is the CRDT designs section where various data strucutres are discussed.

### What’s something I didn’t understand?
There is nothing new in the paper as we have discussed CRDTs before. But in the paper it is mentioned that CvRDTs require weak channel assumption and CmRDTs require strong. Why is that so?

### What’s a research-level question I have after having read this paper?
What all distributed applications are using CRDTs? What level of consistency these applications actually provide? (I am posing the same question from my previous response, as I am still curious to explore this)

### What’s a concrete step I can take toward answering the research question?
My concrete step will be to read more research papers where CRDTs are used in real-time distributed systems.
