## Response: 'Consistency Analysis in Bloom: a CALM and Collected Approach'

### Summary

<p align="justify">
The paper introduces CALM principle which connects distributed consistency and logical monotonicity. The key problem in distributed programming is predicting consistent behavior in the presence of temporal non-determinism. The paper identifies that non-monotonic operations are the ones which require coordination in distributed programming. The feature of CALM principle is the analysis of non-monotonic operations, by identifying the points of order where coordination logic is required.

<p align="justify">
The authors provide an initial prototype of Bloom which is a declarative language that translates the concepts of monotonicity into a practical program analysis technique that detects potential consistency anomalies in distributed Bloom programs.

### What’s one thing I learned?
<p align="justify">
Firstly, I like the idea of counting is waiting and vice-versa to explain the problems with consensus protocols. Secondly, identifying points of order for non-monotonic operations in a program and then analyzing the requirement of coordination logic for the same is a cool idea. I liked the paper from the perspective that it makes a genuine effort to explain the implementation (especially use of graphs).

### What’s a research-level question I have after having read this paper?
<p align="justify">
How mature is Bloom now? Is it being tested for some current distributed framework?
