The quest for what makes for a distributed programming language continues!

Orleans appears to be at its core an actor model, with the one major wrinkle that it
natively supports request/response messages as promises, looking something like an RPC
call.

Individual actors (“grains”) can also be instantiated multiply, with a _shared_ persistent
data store—conflicts to this are reconciled under a branch-and-merge data model. They
don't directly describe how this works, but suggest the data structures they provide have
specific reconciliation mechanisms. It appears the responsibility for handling the merge
correctly lies on the branch, and the state gets merged back in iff the trunk hasn't
changed since.

This is also what allows them to support optimistic transactions across multiple
grains. This is a difficult problem, isn't it? I'd be surprised if anomalies
weren't visible during transaction rollback…

What does this mean? Does this mean a transaction, during its execution, may see the
outside world change in state? The

Why is a 2011 paper describing promises as if they're novel technology? Were they, back
then? Why is a 2011 paper describing in such detail the underlying actor model? I must be
missing something novel here, but I can't tell what it is.

The real novelty, it looks like, is the dynamic scaling up and down of actor/grain
instantiations in response to demand, which is certainly neat, and it's good to see the
self-called “greedy” provisioning policy described…
