Oh, yes, an analysis of Every Consistency Model Ever in the same language! Thank you so
much, Viotti and Vukolić!

Their system model is pretty much standard, as far as I can tell. There's:

* the standard returns-before partial order based on a's ending time being earlier than
  b's start time
* the session-order partial order that respects returns-before within the same process
* the definition of concurrent operations as operations on the same object that aren't
  ordered by returns-before
* the standard potential-causality relation (here called “visibility”)
* the standard conflict resolution operation (here called “arbitration” and modelled as a
  total order on operations—is that a good model for it? probably, but I'm not sure what
  the consequences are of using this model over, say, a merge function of type `op × op →
  ordering`)
* the happens-before partial order that is the extension of session-order with visibility

Their analysis of the state data is in abstracts away all details about the actual data
model—instead, operations have _contexts_, defined as the section of the causal graph
that's visible from op, after arbitration. They also have a free function that specifies
what the allowable results from any operation in a given context is—this will be stricter
for stronger consistency models.

(I don't understand how this model allows for differing arbitration results at different
nodes. How do you specify last-write-wins in weaker consistency models as a total order
when the last write between any two pairs of operations depends entirely on which write
the node saw first?)

So. Under this system model, how do the different consistency semantics we've discussed
layout?

# Linearizability, Safe, and Regular Consistency

Linearizability breaks down into: a `SingleOrder` property, a `RealTime` property, and an
`RVal` property. The `SingleOrder` property states that there's a single global ordering
that both visibility and arbitration respect (and, indeed, are defined by), and `RealTime`
states that arbitration respects returns-before (i.e., wall-clock time). `RVal` is the
standard return-value-consistency predicate specified in terms of the allowable results
from operations in contexts; pretty much every consistency predicate requires this, and
I'll only mention it from now on when a predicate doesn't.

Two related properties are “safe” and “regular” semantics. They both replace the
`RealTime` property with a weaker `RealTimeWrites` property, that only requires that
arbitration respects returns-before for writes returning before other
operations. “Regular” semantics further only requires return-value-consistency for read
operations that are fully ordered with respect to writes by returns-before (i.e., are not
concurrent with any write).

# Weak, Eventual, Strong Eventual, and Quiescent Consistency

Weak consistency, then, provides no properties at all. (Is that true, or is it just that
it provides no properties that can be expressed in this model?)

Eventual consistency we can actually discuss, though. It's comprised of:
`EventualVisibility`, and `NoCircularCausality`. `EventualVisibility` states that for
every operation/process pair, the size of the “intervening set”—the set of operations that
happen in that process that return-after the operation, but do not have visibility of the
operation—is finite. `NoCircularCausality` simply states that happens-before (the
session-order + visibility relation) is acyclic.

“Strong eventual consistency” is eventual consistency with the additional property,
`StrongConvergence`. This is that every read operation of a given piece of data that has
visibility of the same set of writes returns the same value.

“Quiescent consistency” is defined as exactly its single property, `QuiescentConsistency`:
if the number of writes in the system is finite, the number of operations that don't
respect the allowable results of operations is also finite. This property defines a weaker
restriction on operation return values than `RVal`, and so does not require it.

# PRAM and Sequential Consistency

`PRAM` just requires visibility to respect session order (returns-before scoped
to within processes).

Sequential consistency is the combination of this `PRAM` property, the standard `RVal`
return-value-consistency property, and our `SingleOrder` property. In essence, this
makes the single global order that both visibility and arbitration respect (from
`SingleOrder`) have to respect session order, not global wall-clock returns-before order.

# The Read-Your-Writes Family

`MonotonicReads` is that if `r1` occurs before `r2` in session order, for both `r1`, `r2`
reads, then any operation that is visible to `r1` is visible to `r2`. Or, equivalently,
that visibility respects (its transitive closure with) session-ordering of read/read
pairs.

`ReadYourWrites` is that visibility respects session-ordering of write/read pairs.

`MonotonicWrites` is that arbitration respects session-ordering of write/write pairs.

`WritesFollowReads` is that arbitration respects the transitive closure of visibility with
session-ordering on read/write pairs.

The interesting thing to me here is that these definitions are stated in the form of up to
three separate partial orders, each one tightly binding some aspects of one partial order
to another. Together with a return-value-consistency requirement, this seems like it'd be
sufficient to collapse the separate partial orders into one, but having the ability to
refer to them individually is an interesting degree of freedom that I'm curious as to the
actual impact of.

# Causal, Causal+, and Real-time Causal Consistency

`CausalVisibility` and `CausalArbitration` are that visibility and arbitration,
respectively, respect happens-before. Causal consistency itself is the combination of
these properties and the standard return-value-consistency property.

Causal+ consistency, then, is simply causal consistency with `StrongConvergence`. Reads
that have visibility of the same writes have to return the same results, which implies
under causal consistency that writes that happen-before reads have to consistently impact
those reads regardless of replica order of those writes.

Real-time causal consistency is causal consistency with `RealTime` (that arbitration
respects returns-before, wall-clock-time). It's interesting that `RealTime ∧
CausalArbitration` apparently does _not_ imply `StrongConvergence`—intuitively I would've
expected these two tight bounds on arbitration to completely specify it, but I suppose it
doesn't.

# Staleness Models

`TimedVisibility` is that visibility respects all write/read pairs where the write
completes more than some specified amount of time before the read.

Timed causal consistency is causal consistency with `TimedVisibility`, and timed
linearizability is linearizability weakened by replacing `RealTime` with
`TimedVisibility`.

Prefix sequential consistency is `SingleOrder` (that there's a single global order that
both arbitration and visibility respect) alongside `MonotonicWrites` (that arbitration
respects write/write pairs in session-order). Prefix linearizability instead requires
arbitration to respect write/write pairs in returns-before.

K-linearizability is this prefix linearizability, with `K-RealTimeReads`: that arbitration
is transitive across returns-before _for_ arbitrarily small sets of intermediate
writes, on write/write/read triplets. (I don't think I understand this.)

# Fork Models (Byzantine Fault Tolerance)

These are models that involve different nodes maintaining their own potential forks of
data history, as they may have to repair in the presence of malicious/untrusted nodes.

Fork-linearizability combines `PRAM` and `RealTime` (i.e., linearizability, with the
strong global order property on visibility and arbitration replaced with the much
weaker property that visibility respect session order) with `NoJoin`: any two
operations that are not mutually visible require operations later in their respective
session orders to also not be mutually visible.

Fork* consistency weakens `PRAM` to `ReadYourWrites`, and `NoJoin` to `AtMostOneJoin`:
these not mutually visible processes are now allowed to have visibility of at most one
common operation after the fork.

Fork-sequential consistency is fork-linearizability without the `RealTime` property, as
has become standard.

Weak fork-linearizability is fork-linearizability with the `RealTime` property weakened to
`K-RealTime(2)` (that arbitration is transitive across returns-before for sets of
intermediate operations smaller than 2, for all triplets (???)), and `NoJoin` weakened to
`AtMostOneJoin`.

# Per-Object Models

`PerObjectPRAM` is a weakening of `PRAM`: instead of requiring visibility to respect
session order, it requires visibility to respect session order _to the same object_ (i.e.,
the partial order that is just the pairs where session-order and object-order agree).

`PerObjectSingleOrder` is that there's a single order _per object_ that both arbitration
and visibility (as scoped to that object) respect.

Per-object sequential consistency is then, as you'd expect, the combination of these
properties with return-value-consistency. Processor consistency is this strengthened by
using full `PRAM` instead of `PerObjectPRAM`—all of session order is respected in
visibility.
