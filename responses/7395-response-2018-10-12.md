## Response: 'Session Guarantees for Weakly Consistent Replicated Data'

### Summary

The paper focuses on four-session guarantees, namely, read your writes, monotonic reads, monotonic writes and writes follows reads. These guarantees can be applied to any weakly-consistent distributed storage system. Weakly consistent systems provide high-availability, scalability and simplistic design. The paper introduces session guarantees where the read and write operations executed by an application need to be ordered within the session. The four guarantees are:

1.  RYW:  W(x)1 W(x)2 R(X)2 (reading the immediate previous write)
2.  MR:  W(x)1 W(x)2 R(X)2 W(x)4 R(x)4 (for first read X=2 and for second read X=4, so every read, reads unto date database )
3.  WFR:  this is not clear to me exactly
4.  MW: if W(x)1 occurred before W(x)2, then W(x)1 < W(x)2.

Then paper discusses about ways of providing these guarantees. It is the session manager who is responsible for providing guarantees and not the servers. The paper defines eventual consistency to be relied on two properties: total propagation and consistent ordering and introduced the term ‘anti-entropy’ which ensures that each write is eventually received by each server.

### What’s one thing I learned?
The four-session guarantees is a new concept for me.

### What’s something I didn’t understand?
I did not understand write follows read guarantee.

### What’s a research-level question I have after having read this paper?
Really interested in knowing how distributed systems can have a weakly consistent storage which provides high availability and scalability by ensuring these guarantees. Are these guarantees still applicable in modern mobile applications?

### What’s a concrete step I can take toward answering the research question?
Reading papers on distributed systems for mobile applications and how they are dealing with CAP trade-off.
