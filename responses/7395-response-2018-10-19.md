## Response: 'Conflict-free Replicated Data Types'

### Summary

The paper introduces Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) which can provide Strong Eventual Consistency. While looking at the hierarchy of consistency models, I found that Strong Eventual Consistency is lying between Eventual Consistency and Linearizability, so wondering where SEC stands with respect to other consistency models that we have discussed so far. The authors claim that using CRDTs in a replicated environment requires no explicit synchronization and all replicas converge to a correct common state, provided the system remains responsive, available and scalable despite the various kinds of failures. The paper then explains the two types of CRDTs: convergent and commutative, based on the model of replication (state-based and operation based).

In state-based replication, when a replica receives an update from a client, it first updates its local state, and then send its full state to every other replica. All these replicas then apply a merge function to merge their local state with the state they just received. Whereas in operation-based replication, a replica doesn’t send its full state to other replicas, as it can be huge. It just sends the update operation to all the other replicas in the system and expects them to apply that update. In this case, the other replicas can receive updates in different orders and here the paper mentions that ‘updates must be commutative - no matter which order these updates are applied at these replicas, the resulting state will be the same’. But, according to me, there are very limited applications where one can have commutative updates.

One thing which bothered me is the claim they made in the paper that SEC is a solution to CAP theorem which is a very strong claim. I did not find much of evidence in the paper that supports this claim. Also, as I mentioned, having commutative updates is a very system specific thing.

### What’s one thing I learned?
I had already read about CRDTs so there is nothing new in the paper but I never thought CRDTs from SEC perspective. But yes, the paper is dense, so a lot to take in.

### What’s something I didn’t understand?
Also, as I mentioned in my previous review that I did not understand what exactly SEC means? What makes it stricter than Eventual Consistency?
What is SEC model’s relation with respect to other consistency models?

### What’s a research-level question I have after having read this paper?
What all distributed applications are using CRDTs? What level of consistency these applications actually provide?
As paper claims that SEC is a solution to CAP. Is it true? If yes, on what basis?

### What’s a concrete step I can take toward answering the research question?
My concrete step will be to read more research papers where CRDTs are explained from implementation perspective and investigate about the claims which the paper makes.
