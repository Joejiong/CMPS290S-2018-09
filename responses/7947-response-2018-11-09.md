# Response to "Declarative Programming over Eventually Consistent Data Stores"

#### Authors: Sivaramakrishnan et al.

## Summary

The authors describe QUELEA, a declarative programming model which allows the programmer to declare consistency properties for a system via a contract language. QUELEA is also composed of a runtime model for enforcing contracts over an eventually consistent data store (ECDS). I have been reading this paper by comparing it with MixT. The goals of this paper and the MixT paper seem to be similar: both wish to specify consistency levels on data that would all have different consistency levels. This paper creates a declarative programming model over a functional language (Haskell) whereas the MixT paper created a DSL over an imperative programming language (C++). Where MixT allows programmers to define how consistency models could be implemented, QUELEA allows programmer so to declare the consistency properties of the type and lets the underlying runtime system work on how consistency properties would be implemented. 

Since QUELEA is a declarative programming language, it allows programmers to be oblivious to how the system internally implements and enforces contracts. This, I think, is a good way to build distributed programming models (not allowing programmers to not deal with the messy runtime details). However, it also adds limitations on how well programmers can control runtime behaviour.

## Questions

In the paper QUELEA is created over a ECDS where it is assumed that every object is replicated across all data stores. Is this a realistic assumption? I think this is an assumption that quite a few authors make. Normally systems have a replication factor around which they work (at least the few Iâ€™ve read about). How do systems that work around the assumption of a fully replicated data store work on systems which are not fully replicated? (I understand that this assumption applies to this work alone and would probably be removed in a later work, but just wanted to speculate on how this assumption affects the generalizability of the design.)
Where MixT could catch errors in how a programmer was using types with different consistency models, QUELEA removes this burden by doing this at runtime. I am not sure of how interactions between objects with different consistency models was dealt with in this paper (that was one of the goals of the MixT paper).
