# CMPS290S, Fall 2018: Languages and Abstractions for Distributed Programming

This graduate seminar course explores the theory and practice of distributed programming from a programming languages perspective.  We will focus on programming models, language-level abstractions, and verification techniques that attempt to tame the many complexities of distributed systems: inevitable failures of the underlying hardware or network; communication latency resulting from the distance between nodes; the challenge of scaling to handle ever-larger amounts of work; and more.  Most of the work in the course will consist of reading classic and recent papers from the academic literature, writing short responses to the readings, and discussing them in class.  Furthermore, every participant in the class will contribute to a public group blog where we will share what we learn with a broader audience.

## Prerequisites

Familiarity with (or willingness to learn) some basic PL concepts as applied to distributed systems.  An undergraduate programming languages course (or equivalent self-study) should suffice.

## Grading

  - Paper responses: 30%
  - Participation in discussion (online and in class): 20%
  - Paper presentations: 20%
  - Your course blog contributions: 30%

## Readings and responses

One goal of this class is to equip you to conduct research on languages and abstractions for distributed programming by absorbing a lot of papers on the topic.  The [readings page](readings.md) has a list of possible readings.

Each participant in the class will write a response to each reading.  Responses should be in the ballpark of 500-1000 words, and should address the following questions:

  1. What's this paper about?  (Summarize the paper and its contributions in your own words.)
  2. What's one thing I learned?
  3. What's something I didn't understand?
  4. What's a research-level question I'm curious about after having read this paper?  (A "research-level" question is something deeper than "What did the Greek letters on page 4 mean?” or "What's the baseline in Figure 6?" -- those would fall under "What's something I didn't understand about the paper?", above.  Rather, a research-level question might be something like, "The problem you addressed in this paper reminds me of the X problem, which is similar in ways A and B but different in way C.  Could an approach similar to this be used to address X?")
  5. What's one step I can take towards answering the research question?

Free pass policy: Because life throws unexpected challenges at each of us, you get four "free passes" to use during the quarter.  Using a free pass exempts you from having to submit a response for that day's reading.  (Consider using your free passes during weeks that you're writing or editing for the blog, below.)

## Presentations

Each participant in the class will present two or three papers during the course of the quarter.  You should expect to do one or two presentations in October and one or two in November.  You don't have to submit a response for papers that you're presenting.

## Class blog

Each participant in the class will write two posts for the public class blog.  Some possibilities for blog posts include:

  - *The mini lit review*: Choose 3-4 papers related to the topic of the course and write an annotated bibliography for the blog.  At most two of the selected papers should be ones we've already discussed in class.  The idea is to use the papers we read in class as a jumping-off point to explore a specific topic deeply.
  - *The experience report*: Try out one or more of the systems discussed in a paper we read, and report on your experience -- what worked and what didn't.  For this kind of post, you should expect to write code.  Aim higher than just “I got it to compile and run” -- ideally, you'll use the system to accomplish something.  At a minimum, you can try to reproduce the performance results in the paper.
  - *Run someone's research*: Choose a "lightweight language mechanization" tool, such as PLT Redex or K, and use it to mechanize and test a language or system model from one of the papers we read.  Report on what you learned from this process.

Your two blog posts should be spaced out over the fall quarter.  As a rough guideline, you should aim to finish one post during October and one during November.

Blog posts are informal, but that doesn't mean we don't expect a high standard of writing for the blog.  Therefore, in addition to writing your own posts for the blog, you will also serve as an editor for two posts (other than your own).  The role of the editor is to help the writer do their best work -- by reading drafts, asking clarifying questions, and spotting mistakes and rough spots.  We'll pair up editors with writers as the quarter proceeds.
