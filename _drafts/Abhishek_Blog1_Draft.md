# Title: Conflict resolution in collaborative document editing

#### Abhishek Alfred Singh

## Introduction

The main idea I would like to discuss in this blogpost is "how do we manage conflicts in collaborative work". We will look into collaborative work environments  such as version control systems, collaborative text editors, etc., and try to understand the issues that such environments have to deal with and ultimately, how possible ways of resolving these conflicts.

Anyone who has used a version control system and worked in a collaborative setting knows all too well the problems which arise when there are conflicts in a document or code people have been editing.
