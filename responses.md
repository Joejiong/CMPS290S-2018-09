# Responses to readings

_This page is a draft and subject to change._

For each reading, you will write a response and submit it by 11am on the day we discuss that reading in class (see the [readings page](readings.md) for a schedule).  Late responses will not be accepted.  You'll write your responses in Markdown format and submit them as pull requests to a GitHub repo.  (Further logistical details forthcoming.)

Class is at 1:20PM, so you have a chance to glance over other people's responses after submitting yours, so you know what to <s>argue with them about</s> discuss with them in class.

Responses should be in the ballpark of 500 to 1000 words, which is about the minimum length that, say, a PLDI review should be.  But responding to these reaadings is quite different from reviewing submissions to a conference.  For one thing, we're reading stuff that has (with a few possible exceptions) already been thoroughly peer-reviewed.  Your goal here isn't to assess the quality of the papers.  Rather, your goal is to learn -- to construct a rich mental map of literature in the field, and to build a foundation for your own work.  To that end, you should structure your response around the following questions:

  1. What's this paper about?  (Summarize the paper and its contributions in your own words.)
  2. What's one thing I learned?
  3. What's something I didn't understand?
  4. What's a research-level question I'm curious about after having read this paper?  (A "research-level" question is something deeper than "What did the Greek letters on page 4 mean?" or "What's the baseline in Figure 6?" -- those would fall under a"What's something I didn't understand about the paper?", above.  Rather, a research-level question might be something like, "The problem you addressed in this paper reminds me of the X problem, which is similar in ways A and B, but different in way C.  Could this paper's approach, or something like it, be used to address X?")
  5. What are some concrete steps can I take toward answering the research question?

## Alternative response structures

The five questions above are intended to help you structure your response structure.  You may find that what you have to say about the reading doesn't fit neatly into answers to those five questions.  (You also may not have a research question about every reading.)  In that case, feel free to try structuring your response differently.  Below are some alternative response structures:

### From [Heather Miller](http://heather.miller.am/teaching/cs7680/reading-papers.html):

  1. What are the contributions of this work? How novel or significant are they?
  2. How does the paper relate to other papers you've read?
  3. What problem did the authors solve? How well did they solve it? What are the limitations of the presented solution? Is there some simple solution that the authors may have overlooked?
  4. Are the assumptions that motivate this work sound and reasonable?
  5. What questions are you left with? Is anything unclear?

### From [William Griswold](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~wgg/CSE210/paperform.pdf):

  1. What is your take-away message from this paper?
  2. What is the motivation for this work (both people problem and technical problem), and its distillation into a research question?  _Why doesn't the people problem have a trivial solution?  What are the previous solutions and why are they inadequate?_
  3. What is the proposed solution (hypothesis, idea, design)?  _Why is it believed it will work?  How does it represent an improvement?  How is the solution achieved?_
  4. What is the author's evaluation of the solution?  _What logic, argument, evidence, artifacts (e.g., a proof-of-concept system), or experiments are presented in support of the idea?_
  5. What is your analysis of the identified problem, idea and evaluation?  _Is this a good idea?  What flaws do you perceive in the work?  What are the most interesting or controversial ideas?  For work that has practical implications, ask whether this will work, who would want it, what it will take to give it to them, and when might it become a reality?_
  6. What are the paper's contributions (author's and your opinion)?  _Ideas, methods, software, experimental results, experimental techniques...?_
  7. What are future directions for this research (author's and yours, perhaps driven by shortcomings or other critiques)?
  8. What questions are you left with?  _What questions would you like to raise in an open discussion of the work (review interesting and controversial points, above)?  What do you find difficult to understand?  List as many as you can._

### From [Ethan Miller](https://courses.soe.ucsc.edu/courses/cmps290s/Fall11/01/pages/syllabus):

  1. What is the problem or issue addressed by the reading, and why is the problem important?
  2. What approaches are discussed in the reading, and how dow they help address the problem or issue?
  3. What other approaches (if any) are mentioned in the reading, and how are the approaches in the reading better than alternatives?
  4. Three or more comments/questions about the reading.
